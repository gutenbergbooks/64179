<p>The Substance of the following pages was given in two lectures, which
I delivered last year to the Members of “The Society for Promoting
Religious and Useful Knowledge.” Since then I have collected a few more
facts relating to the early history of Bridgnorth, which I have here
given to the reader, and I have also added an <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>,
containing some matter not altogether, I hope, undeserving of attention,
although some of it is only remotely connected with my subject. The public
documents relating to the town, such as the Terms of Capitulation, and
the Proclamation of Charles II., it has been thought desirable to give
entire, as but few copies of them, especially of the latter, are extant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem superfluous for me, after the many quotations which I
have taken from his learned work on “The Antiquities of Shropshire,” to
make any acknowledgement of my obligations to the Rev. Robert Eyton.
But I owe him much more than is indicated by these quotations. He very
kindly directed my attention to sources of information respecting
Bridgnorth, which have been of the greatest service to me, particularly
the Blakeway Papers, in the Bodleian Library, besides allowing me to
refer to his better judgment and more extensive information, on any
difficulty that occurred to me.</p>

<p>I am very much indebted also to Mr. Whitmore, of Apley, for his
kindness in giving me the free use of his own collection of historical
notices of our town and neighbourhood, from the MSS. in his possession.
I would gladly avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my thanks
likewise to the Town Clerk, for allowing me to consult the Common Hall
Order Books, and other documents belonging to the Corporation; and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Mr. Hubert Smith for giving me his valuable assistance in decyphering
them. Nor should I omit to offer my thanks to the Rev. G. L. Wasey, for
some interesting particulars which he communicated to me, respecting
the early history of Quatford; and to Mr. S. Sidney Smith, from whose
antiquarian lore I have, on several points, derived much valuable information.

  <h2 class="nobreak">THE ANTIQUITIES OF<br /> BRIDGNORTH.<br />PART I.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r25" />

<p>The first thing which naturally engages our attention, in considering
the Antiquities of Bridgnorth, is the origin of its name. This, as well
as other names just as simple and intelligible, has afforded matter
for the ingenious speculations of etymologists, who, by a sort of
alchemy, of which they only are the masters, have transmuted it into a
form totally different from its own. For instance, some have made it
out that the name signifies the tower or castle on Morfe, and that it
was originally <i>Burgmorfe</i>, the first syllable of which, “Burg,” being
derived from the Greek word πυργος, ‘a tower’, the other being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the Saxon name of the neighbouring forest, which extended over the
large district still so called. But it is not easy to conceive, how
“Burg” should have been transmuted into “Bridge,” and still less so,
how “Morfe” should have been corrupted into “North.” The name is a
very plain one, and just as plain is its etymology; <i>Bridgnorth i.
e.</i> the north Bridge, or the bridge lying to the north of some other
bridge. In every ancient record it is called “<i>Brugge</i>” or “<i>Brug</i>,”
the Saxon form of the word “Bridge,” and there is no instance, I am
informed, of the syllable “North” being added to it, at least in any
public document, earlier than the reign of Edward I. Bridges in early
times were not so common as they are now, and therefore a place, which
had a bridge or bridges of any size, often took its name from this
circumstance. Thus Bruges, a town in Flanders, was so named, from the
numerous bridges over the canals, which intersect it; and Bridgetown,
near which the famous battle of the Boyne was fought, was so called
on account of the bridge, which there crosses the river. So our town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
received its first name of “<i>Brug</i>” from the bridge, which here spanned
the Severn; and was afterwards called “<i>Bridgnorth</i>,” to distinguish it
from a bridge lower down the Severn, at Quatford.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>After the origin of the name, the next thing to consider is the
first foundation of Bridgnorth. There is no doubt that this is very
ancient, probably as ancient as the age of Alfred the Great. The
Saxon chroniclers inform us that Ethelfleda, the daughter of Alfred,
who inherited the magnanimity which has made her father’s name so
illustrious in the page of history, aided her brother Edward in
resisting the incursions of the Danes; and for this purpose erected
several forts and castles in different parts of the country, and among
these one at Bridgnorth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that the Danes, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 896, having been
driven from their settlements on the banks of the Thames, and their fleet
having been destroyed, retreated northward, and at last made their way
to the Forest of Morfe, adjacent to Quatford, where, as some writers
record, they entrenched themselves in a strong fortification.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
We have proof of their having been in this neighbourhood, from the fact
that a place between Bridgnorth and Quatford still bears the name of
<i>Danesford</i>, marking the spot, where no doubt these wild marauders
found a passage across the Severn, which passage they no doubt used in
carrying on their depredations on the east side of the stream. There is
supposed to be other local evidence of the Danes having settled for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a time in this neighbourhood, which is not without its interest. I
refer to the discovery, made by Mr. Stackhouse, formerly Incumbent of
St. Mary’s, of an ancient burial ground upon Morfe, which from its
character he supposed to be Danish.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The following account of it, together with the subjoined sketch, is
given in the 460th Number of the Philosophical Transactions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_005" name="P_005">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_005.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="486" />
</div>

<p>“In July, 1740, I observed upon Morfe the tumuli as above represented,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
where the soil is a strong gravel. Mountfaucon tells us that the old
Cimbri, [the Danes,] were wont to throw up gravel on their graves, and
the more remarkable the persons were, the larger the tumuli over them.
I therefore imagined that this might possibly be the burying place of
the Danes. For satisfaction, I caused the middle and largest of these
tumuli to be dug from north to south, (a.a.) supposing that by that
method I might cross the site of the body that may have been laid
there. We dug about seven feet deep, even to the solid rock, without
meeting anything remarkable but an iron shell, in the shape of an
egg, with a round hole at one end; but so cankered and decayed, that
it easily broke into small pieces. This we judged to be the boss of a
sword. However, on viewing the trench that we had dug, we perceived on
the west side of it a hollow in the gravel, which upon trial extended
horizontally four or five feet; and under this hollow (b.b.) we found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
one of the large vertebræ of the loins, with its processes pretty
perfect, but thoroughly petrified; and upon further search, several
portions of bones, all alike petrified, but so disguised that we could
not discover to what part of the body they belonged. We afterwards
opened one of the lesser tumuli, (c.c.) and found what is thought to
be the os sacrum, and many other small pieces of bone, in a petrified
state. It was great odds that we found nothing at all, but nature
favoured us by preserving some few tokens of antiquity.” Mr. Stackhouse
seems to have been disturbed in his archeological researches; for he
mentions that the people of Bridgnorth flocked in great numbers to the
spot, expecting to see great wonders, and to prevent further concourse, he
was glad to fill up the trenches, and to leave the other tumuli unexamined.</p>

<p>From local and historical evidence then, it would appear that the Danes
took refuge amidst the forests<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
which then covered that extensive district, and continued to hold possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of them for some time. But this was the last scene of their struggle
against the Saxons, during the reign of Alfred. They were compelled
after a while to leave these fastnesses upon Morfe; and Shropshire, and
soon after the whole of England, was delivered from their rule. Then
it was that Ethelfleda, in concert with her brother Edward, in order
to guard against any attempts the Danes might make to regain their
footing in the country, built castles in those places which were most
liable to be attacked. One of these, as has been already mentioned,
was erected at Bridgnorth, or, as it was then called, “Brugge.” This
establishes the fact, that our town, whatever may have been its exact
size and situation, existed long before the Norman conquest, and that
its foundation reaches back more than nine hundred years. But it is a
higher honor to the town of Bridgnorth than even the great antiquity of
its foundation, that it is thus associated in its early history with
the name of this great princess—a name which poets and historians have
justly made illustrious—and that amid the dangers which threatened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
nation, she took such special means to provide for its defence.</p>

<p>But what was the site of the castle which she erected at Bridgnorth?
This is a question of very great interest. Most of those who have
enquired into the subject have supposed it to be the eminence now
known by the name of <i>The Castle Hill</i>; but Mr. Eyton, (<i>Antiquities
of Shropshire, Vol. 1, part 4, pp. 131, 132</i>) whose sagacity equals
his learning on antiquarian subjects, has assigned to it a different
site, and has most probably discovered its true locality. Every one
has noticed, on looking westward from the Castle Walk, a very singular
mound of earth, about two hundred yards distant, the regular shape
of which plainly proves it to be artificial. It is now known by the
name of “Pam-pudding Hill.” This Mr. Eyton considers to be the site
of Ethelfleda’s castle, and supports his assertion on the following
grounds. A document is extant, of the date of Edward I., in which the
road beneath this hill is called the road underneath “the Old Castle.”
Now the castle on what is at present called the Castle Hill, was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the time of Edward I. the existent and garrisoned castle of the town:
so that the “Old Castle” must have been a term denoting some fortress
of a more ancient date; and as we have no record of any earlier castle
but that built by Ethelfleda, this, which bore in the reign of Edward
I. the title of the “Old Castle,” must have been hers. It is to be
observed also, that the hill, called “Pam-pudding Hill,” is situate in
the parish of Oldbury, a word which plainly signifies “<i>Old Borough</i>;”
and as Ethelfleda attached a borough to the castles which she built,
there can be no doubt that the neighbouring village of Oldbury, however
small its circumference at present, has the honor of being the original
borough, having the site of the ancient castle erected by this Saxon
princess within its borders; and that Bridgnorth at the time was little
better than an appendage to it.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But in less than two centuries after the erection of this fortress,
Bridgnorth became a place of consequence; the commanding position on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which it stood, and the strong natural defences of the place, marking
it out to the eye of a very bold and ambitious nobleman of the day, as
a situation eminently fitted for a fortified castle. This nobleman was
Robert de Belesme, the son and eventual successor to the English titles
and estates of Roger de Montgomery, first Earl of Shrewsbury. Roger
was a kinsman of William the Conqueror, as well as a very faithful
vassal; and when William became possessed by conquest of this fair
realm of England, he liberally rewarded his services by the grant of a
very large share of territory in the conquered kingdom. He conferred
on him the Earldom of Shrewsbury, with a feoff of four hundred and
six manors, in which Quatford is included.—(<i>Blakeway’s History of
Shrewsbury, Vol. 1, p. 37, note 3.</i>) This he appears to have chosen as
his favourite place of residence, perhaps on account of the opportunity
it afforded him of indulging his Norman propensity for hunting; for
the forest of Morfe was close adjacent to it. Here he not only built a
castle,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
but also built and endowed a Collegiate Church, and founded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
a borough. All these however, the privileges of the borough, the
garrison of the castle, and the chief endowments of the church, his
son Robert de Belesme transferred to Bridgnorth. But the foundation
of Quatford Church is an historical event of so much interest, and is
so intimately connected with the early history of Bridgnorth, that it
deserves more than a passing reference.</p>

<p>The following is the substance of the narrative of the event given
by John Brompton, an ancient chronicler, who lived in the reign of
King John:—In the year 1082 Roger de Montgomery married his second
wife, Adelissa, daughter of Ebrard de Pusey, one of the chief nobles
of France. As she was sailing into England to join her husband, she
was overtaken by a dreadful tempest, from which the mariners thought
there could be no escape. In the midst of this furious storm one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ecclesiastics, who accompanied her, wearied with watching, fell asleep;
and in his sleep he dreamed that a female appeared to him, and thus
addressed him:—“If thy lady would wish to save herself, and her
attendants from the present danger of the sea, let her make a vow to
God, and faithfully promise to build a church in honour of the blessed
Mary Magdalene, on the spot where she may first happen to meet her
husband, the Earl, in England; especially where groweth a hollow oak,
and the wild swine have shelter.” The story goes on to state, that,
when he awoke from sleep, he communicated to his lady the particulars
of this singular dream, and that she at once made the prescribed vow.
The tempest soon calmed, and she and her attendants landed safely in
some port in England, from whence she immediately made her journey to
her husband’s estates in Shropshire; and just on the top of Quatford
hill, which was at that time in the outskirts of the Earl’s hunting
ground, and near a spot where an oak tree was growing, she met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
him, engaged in his favorite pastime: and there at her request, in
fulfilment of her vow, he built a church and richly endowed it.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There are now on the high ground just above the church at Quatford,
several oaks whose gnarled and knotted trunks seem to have borne the
brunt of many centuries. They are evidently of a very ancient date. No
one can attentively observe them, without seeing that they must have
outlived several generations of men; and there can be but little doubt
that they are right in their conjecture, who suppose them to belong
to the original forest of Morfe. The supposition, that trees which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
flourished in the time of William Rufus may be still standing, need not
be considered extravagant; for the history of the oak and yew
tree<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
in England furnishes many instances of equal longevity. “Among the
most remarkable of such trees,” says Mr. Wright, in his <i>History of
Ludlow</i>, p. 181, “in the neighbourhood of Ludlow, may be mentioned the
aged oak on the brow of the hill of Nonupton, or Nuns’ Upton, near the
village of Little Hereford, which was probably standing there previous
to the Conquest.... The tree is hollowed by decay, and its branches
mutilated by the effects of time.” An oak is at present growing in
Chepstowe Park, called the Parliamentary Oak, from the fact that Edward
I. convened his Parliament under it in 1290. Mr. Gilpin mentions a more
remarkable instance: “Close by the gate of the water walk at Magdalene
College, in Oxford, grew an oak, which perhaps stood a sapling when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Alfred founded the University. That period only includes nine hundred
years, no great age,” writes Mr. Gilpin, “for an oak. This oak could
almost produce historical evidence for its age. About five hundred
years after Alfred’s time, William of Wainfleet expressly ordered his
College to be founded near <i>the great oak</i>; and an oak could not well
be less than five hundred years old, to merit that title. In the summer
of 1788 it fell.” (<i>Gilpin’s Forest Scenery, Vol. 1, p. 141.</i>) But a
much more ancient oak than even this a short time since was standing in
Stirling, one which there is reason to believe existed in the time of
the Druids, and which was so much decayed in the thirteenth century,
that William Wallace and several of his officers used to take shelter
at night in its hollow trunk. (<i>Forest Trees of Britain, by Rev. C.A.
Johns, pp. 80, 81.</i>)</p>

<p>These facts are sufficient to show that it is by no means improbable,
that the oaks now standing in Quatford were originally trees in the
Forest of Morfe; if so, one of them may be the very tree which marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
out to the Countess Adelissa the spot, adjacent to which she was to
build the Church. Now among these oaks, one is of a very remarkable
character. Time has so completely decayed the middle part of the tree,
that the two portions of the trunk which remain have fallen asunder
one from the other, and thus appear at first sight as two separate and
distinct trees<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>—indeed, they are generally supposed to be so—but a
closer examination will disprove this. It will be noticed that the bark
is very much curled up, and if this could be unrolled, it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
found to belong to a trunk, the circumference of which would include
the two parts now remaining.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_018" name="P_018">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_018.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="499" />
</div>

<p>The above is a sketch of the tree in its present condition. Of course
it would be very absurd, as well as unwarrantable, to assert that
this is the hollow oak referred to in the narrative; but it is very
likely, from its appearance, that the tree has been hollow for very
many centuries; and this gives a degree of shadowy probability to the
conjecture, enough to invest the speculation with some amount of interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The church which now tops the neighbouring hill is an object that
strikes every visitor of this district; and among the churches of
our native land there are few that rival it in beauty of situation.
But it is an object of great interest, not only on this account, but
also because it is, in some parts of the structure at least, the very
church which was built very nearly eight hundred years ago by Roger
de Montgomery, in ratification of his wife’s vow; and stands at this
distant day, a monument of the faithfulness of her promise. Those who
are skilled in archeological researches entertain no doubt, both from
its form and from the nature of the material used in its construction,
that a part of the chancel belongs to the ancient church of Quatford,
of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>It was a wild and unfrequented spot on which it stood when first
erected; but on the day of its consecration, this sequestered scene was
thronged with a vast concourse of people, and must have exhibited a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
imposing spectacle: for we learn from an ancient document, that
there assisted at the ceremony three Bishops, Woolstan, Bishop of
Worcester, then above eighty years of age; the Bishop of Hereford, and
the Bishop of Chester; six Archdeacons from neighbouring dioceses,
and other ecclesiastics; besides several nobles of high degree, each
with their accustomed attendants; and many officials and retainers of
the Earl of Shrewsbury. And when we remember the gorgeous manner in
which ceremonials of this kind were got up in the middle ages: when
knights and ecclesiastics, barons and prelates, each in his appropriate
costume, walked in solemn procession; when the pomp of heraldry and the
sacred insignia of the Church were united to do honor to the occasion,
we may judge what a striking and impressive scene was witnessed on the
day of the dedication of this church on the hill of Quatford. The Earl
richly endowed this church, constituted it a collegiate establishment,
built a castle<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
somewhere contiguous to it, and made a borough of the surrounding
district; but the borough, castle, and collegiate establishment were
soon after his death transferred to Bridgnorth; and in this way the
history of Quatford is connected with the early history of our town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to consider more particularly the cause of this transfer,
and the building, fortifying, and garrisoning the Castle of Bridgnorth,
in the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1102, by Robert de Belesme, the
successor of Roger first Earl of Shrewsbury. This nobleman was of a most
restless and ambitious spirit, and immediately after the death of William II.
entered into a confederacy with other Normans to dethrone Henry I, and
to set up his brother Robert Duke of Normandy in his stead, who landed
in England in order to further their undertaking. The scheme was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
defeated by the promptitude and sagacity of the king, who came to
an accommodation with his brother, and induced him to return to
Normandy; and then he turned his hand against the chief conspirators.
After citing Robert de Belesme to appear before him, he publicly
proclaimed him an outlaw, and proceeded against him as such; first
laying siege to his castle at Arundel in Sussex. Meanwhile Belesme
had not been idle, but had set about building and fortifying a castle
in Bridgnorth.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
He considered our hill rising in the midst of the valley of the
Severn, and strongly fortified on most sides by natural defences,
and commanding the adjacent country, as a fine military position,
entrenched within which, he might for a long time, at least till
succour was sent him by the confederates, hold out against the royal
forces. He therefore engaged in this work with great vigour, and
accomplished it with incredible speed. He had indeed no time to lose;
but he completed the work in less than a year, before the king could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
disengage himself from his other enterprises, so as to allow of his
following him to Bridgnorth. Florence of Worcester, in his Chronicle,
states that he hastened the completion of this work, carrying it on
night and day, and that he excited the Welshmen, who were in subjection
to him, to the more faithful and speedy performance of his wishes, by
awarding to them with a liberal hand, honours, lands, horses, asses,
and all sorts of gifts. (<i>p. 324</i>, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>
1803, <i>English Translation</i>.) When we consider the strength of the
Castle, and the solidity of its structure, it is quite marvellous that
it could have been raised and fortified within so short a space of
time. We may judge of the solid character of the building, by the only
fragment which now remains of it, which is of the most massive kind of masonry.</p>

<p>It is difficult at this time to ascertain the exact dimensions of the
castle; but this description of it by Leland, an antiquary of the time
of Henry VIII, may give us some conception of what it was originally.
“The Castle standeth on the south part of the town, and is fortified by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
east with the profound valley instead of a ditch. The walls of it
be of great height. There were two or three stronge wardes in the
castle, that now goe totally to ruine. I count the castle to be more in
compasse than a third part of the town. There is one mighty gate by the
north of it, now stopped up; and a little postern made by force thereby
through the wall, to enter into the castle. The castle ground, and
especially the base court, hath many dwelling houses of timber in it,
newly erected.” It occupied, no doubt, a large portion of what is now
called the Castle Hill; but its outworks and walls must have extended
much farther. It is very likely that the gully, which now forms the
passage of the Stony Way, was originally an artificial fosse or ditch,
made for its defence in that direction. It is also in the memory of
many, that there stood, on or near the site of the new Town Hall, a
part of an ancient arch, which was evidently connected with the old
castle, and perhaps formed its northern gateway, or the smaller postern
which Leland mentions: so that its extent must have been considerable,
and its different appendages have occupied a large space of ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_025" name="P_025">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_025.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="487" />
</div>

<p>The above is a representation of the arch referred to, as it stood some
years ago, and I believe very faithfully portrays it.</p>

<p>But nothing perhaps can give us a truer notion of the extent of the
Castle of Bridgnorth, and of the magnitude of the building, than the
great sums of money which were from time to time expended on its
repair. We may thus judge of the cost of its first erection. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
existing documents, which shew that from the reign of Henry II. to
that of Henry III., there was a sum of money laid out in additions and
repairs, amounting to more than £14,000 of modern currency.</p>

<p>It must indeed have been a most noble structure; and standing on such
a commanding eminence, overlooking the course of the Severn in both
directions, must have been almost without its equal. The traveller,
as he came suddenly on the view of it from the Hermitage Hill, must
have been struck with the beauty of the scene, in which it formed so
prominent an object; and an enemy approaching it, from almost any
quarter, might well be daunted by the remarkable strength of its
position. One cannot but deeply regret the unnecessary and wanton
demolition of it by the Parliamentary forces, in the Civil Wars. Had
the ruthless soldiers of Cromwell been contented with dismantling it
and taking away its defences, and reducing it as a fortress, it would
still, crowning the hill, have formed, in its dismantled condition, one
of the most picturesque ruins in England, and made our town a centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of attraction to the lovers of antiquity. The sole remaining fragment
of this noble castle is indeed one of the curiosities of Bridgnorth,
for, like the leaning tower of Pisa, it is considerably out of the
perpendicular; but the chief interest belonging to it, is its being the
last relic of the famous feudal fortress of Robert de Belesme, and its
having been not only a military garrison, but also a royal residence at
several eventful periods of English history.</p>

<p>After Belesme had with such astonishing dispatch built and fortified
this castle, he garrisoned it with stipendiary soldiers, and placed
it under the command of Roger, son of Corbat; but he himself, on the
approach of the King, retired to Shrewsbury, where he prepared to
make a vigorous resistance. The King advanced on Bridgnorth, and laid
siege to the castle. It is plain, from the numerous forces which he
collected on the occasion, that he considered this enterprise one of
some difficulty. The Saxon chronicle states that “he went <i>with all
his army</i> to Bridgnorth, and resided there till he had the Castle.”

the same event in these words: “he himself besieged Bridgnorth,
with <i>the army of nearly all England</i>.” Even if we take these words
in a qualified sense, they shew what vast preparations the King
made for this siege, and what a large military array the fields
around Bridgnorth must have exhibited on this occasion: nearly all
the forces which the sovereign could assemble—legions of Norman
and Saxon soldiers—hosts of infantry, horsemen, spearmen, and
archers—accompanied by siege trains, such as were then in use—led on
also by gallant knights, the flower of England’s chivalry—and animated
by the presence of the King himself. The little garrison within the
Castle, when they looked down from their walls on this formidable host,
as they were crossing the Severn, or winding their way beneath the base
of the hill, must have felt great confidence in the strength of their
position, not to have been ready to surrender on the first summons. But
they held out for three weeks, when an incident occurred which for a
while interrupted the siege.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The nobles who followed the King were unwilling that he should crush
so powerful a feudal Lord as Belesme, lest the regal power over the
vassal nobility might become excessive. On a day, therefore, when the
siege had made some progress, they held a meeting, in a field where
the royal army was encamped, and advancing to the King, proposed that
he should offer terms of accommodation to the Earl. But their purpose
had transpired, and the country gentlemen of Shropshire, manifesting
a spirit of loyalty, which happily has been transmitted to their
descendants, assembled on one of the hills which surrounded the King’s
camp, to the number of three thousand, and lifting up their voice, as
the old chronicler relates, exclaimed, “Sir King, regard not what these
traitors say: remember the repeated treason of this your enemy—how
often he has conspired against your life—and lay not aside your
purpose: storm the town. We will support you, and never leave you till
your foe is brought alive or dead to your feet.” Encouraged by their
loyalty, the King at once adopted vigorous measures, which succeeded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
He summoned Corbat and the other governors before him, and swore, in
the presence of his court, that if within three days they did not
surrender the castle, he would hang the whole of the garrison. These
threats had the desired effect. The garrison agreed to surrender:
they shut up the stipendiaries in one part of the castle, and opened
their gates to the King, who entered amid the acclamations of the
townspeople. Soon after the capture of the castle, the King set out for
Shrewsbury, in pursuit of Robert de Belesme; and having surmounted the
dangerous pass, as it was then considered, of Wenlock Edge, and cut his
way through the entangling forest which lay at its base, he laid siege
to Shrewsbury. But Belesme, alarmed at the bold and energetic movements
of the King, surrendered himself to his mercy.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
His life was spared; but he was banished to Normandy, and all his
English estates became forfeit to the crown. His history was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
marked by many disasters, and at length he died in a prison at Warham
Castle, where he had languished some years in miserable captivity.
Such was the wretched issue of treachery and rebellion—such the bitter
fruits of “vaulting ambition”—such the consequence of setting aside
that divine principle, which is alike the safeguard of personal peace,
as well as of public tranquillity, “Fear God, honor the King.”</p>

<p>The castle of Bridgnorth, after its surrender, became one of the
Royal Castles of England, and was occasionally made the residence of
Henry I. This is ascertained from the fact of some charters, granted
by him, being dated at “Brug”—Bridgnorth—and also from the Sheriff
of the County, by the King’s order, sending a quantity of wine into
the castle—a circumstance which was anticipatory of a royal visit.
(<i>Eyton’s Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1., pp. 246-7.</i>)</p>

<p>But after an interval of about sixty years, Bridgnorth Castle sustained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
a second siege, in the reign of Henry II, conducted by the King in
person. It was at this time in the possession of Hugh de Mortimer, one
of the adherents of the late usurper, King Stephen. On the accession
of the new monarch, he caballed against him, and having fortified his
three Castles of Wigmore, Cleobury, and Bridgnorth, prepared to bid
defiance to the royal arms. The Castle of Cleobury was soon taken
and destroyed, but the Castle of Bridgnorth held out for more than
two months, when it was compelled to surrender to the besiegers. Two
circumstances are connected with the narrative of this siege, which are
not without interest. Some charters were granted by the King while the
siege was carrying on, the subscribing names of the witnesses to which
shew that Henry on this occasion was attended by many persons of high
rank, both civil and ecclesiastical. Among these appears the name of
one, who is as conspicuous in the annals of English history as perhaps
any other individual, and who by his ambitious pretensions, seconded by
abilities of a very high order, and a dauntless spirit, disturbed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
reign of Henry II. more than all his foreign enemies, and for the
murder of whom the King was obliged to perform the most humiliating
penance at his tomb—the famous Thomas á Becket. A charter granted
to Stoneleigh Abbey, and dated, “Apud Brugiam in obsidione”—at
Bridgnorth during the siege—is signed by Thomas á Becket, as one of
the witnesses; (<i>Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1, pp. 249-50</i>) so
that if any of our townsmen should make a pilgrimage of curiosity to
his shrine at Canterbury, it may add somewhat to its interest to know,
that this renowned ecclesiastic was present with the royal forces at
Bridgnorth, during the second investment of the Castle.</p>

<p>The other circumstance to which I refer is an act of devoted loyalty on
the part of one of King Henry’s attendants, which is said to have taken
place at this siege. While the King was directing the operations of
the assault, one of the garrison from the walls of the castle aimed an
arrow at him. The shaft sprung from the bow, and was so well directed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
that it would have pierced the breast of the King, had not a Knight,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
observing the danger, and seeing no other mode of averting it,
immediately stepped before the King, and received the arrow in his own
body, and died at the feet of his sovereign:<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
an instance of generous valour, which is not without its parallel in
modern history. I refer to an incident which took place at the battle
of Ferozeshaw, in India, about ten years since. The Commander-in-chief,
the noble hearted Lord Gough, seeing a part of his line stagger under
the fire of the enemy, bethought him if he could direct even a portion
of the cannonade for a few moments to another point, the crisis of the
battle would be passed. He forthwith rode forward, attended by a single
aid-de-camp, and making himself prominently conspicuous to the Sikh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
gunners, moved slowly to one side, as if for the purpose of
reconnoitering the entrenchments close at hand. In an instant almost
every gun in the battery was turned upon him. The shot ploughed up the
dust about him, so as well nigh to hide both himself and his horse
from the enemy’s view, yet not one took effect; and so complete was
the diversion, that the line of infantry felt as if relieved, and with
a shout sprang forward. The next moment saw the redoubt, with all the
artillery which it contained, in their possession. (<i>Quarterly Review,
No.</i> <span class="smcap">clv</span>, <i>p. 205</i>) The heart of this
British General at the battle of Ferozeshaw, and of the Norman Knight
at the siege of Bridgnorth, were animated with the same spirit of dauntless
gallantry. They were both cast in the same mould of ancient chivalry.</p>

<p>There are no public documents, I believe, of much interest, which
refer to Bridgnorth during the reign of Richard I; but there are very
frequent notices of it in the reign of his successor King John. He
visited the town on several occasions. It has been observed respecting
this king, that nothing could show more plainly the unsettled state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the realm of England during his reign than his moving about so
continually, as he did, from one part of the kingdom to another; for
during the whole of the eighteen years of his reign he scarcely ever remained
more than a few days in one place. (<i>Wyld’s History of Ludlow, p. 134.</i>)</p>

<p>The frequent disturbances which occurred on the Welsh borders drew
him into Shropshire, and it was on these occasions that he visited
Bridgnorth. He was here, for instance, in the year 1200; and again
four years afterwards. On the latter occasion he was attended by a
splendid retinue. There were in his train the Bishops of Lincoln and
of Hereford—the Earls of Essex, Pembroke, Chester, Salisbury, Warren,
Lancaster, Warwick, and Hereford: also the Provost of Beverley, and
Hugh de Nevil, and William Briwere; and it may give us some idea of
the extent of Bridgnorth Castle in those days, that it could afford
accommodation not only to the King and his immediate attendants, but to
so large a train of noblemen and knights, and lodge within its walls the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
retainers of so numerous a Court. King John had not at this, or at any
other period of his reign, much occasion for holding high festivities,
yet it appears that he indulged in them at this visit to Bridgnorth
Castle; for although the visit lasted but three days it cost the King,
what in our currency would amount to £2000. There is a writ extant,
dated 1204, by which the King orders his treasurer to pay back that sum
to the Sheriff of the County, for expenses incurred during his visit at
Bridgnorth.—(<i>Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 265.</i>)</p>

<p>He was again at Bridgnorth in the month of August, 1212—a very
calamitous period of his reign—when the kingdom was placed under
the Papal Interdict, and his subjects absolved from their oath of
allegiance; and the extraordinary rapidity of his movements in
various directions at this time—almost incredible if it were not
fully authenticated—shews the restless anxiety of his mind under the
embarrassing circumstances in which he was placed. For instance, in
the month of May he was in Hampshire; two months later, we find him at
Bristol, July 26th; on the 27th, at Devizes, in Wiltshire; on the 29th,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
at Winchester; at Marlborough on the same day; at Tewkesbury on the
day following; the next day at Worcester; the next day at Bridgnorth;
in the heart of Powis land on the 2nd, where he stormed and levelled
to the ground the famous Castle of Mathraval; and then back again to
Bridgnorth. These expeditious movements and energetic exploits of King
John shewed that he inherited some of the vigour which characterized
the noble race of the Plantagenets, to which he belonged, though
usually this native energy was kept in abeyance, probably by an almost
unceasing consciousness of crime. (<i>Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1,
pp. 268-9.</i>)</p>

<p>In this hurried journey of the King from Worcester to the Welch
borders, through Bridgnorth, it is curious to notice the variety of
things which he thought it necessary to have conveyed with him, most
of which, however, he was obliged to leave behind him in Bridgnorth
Castle. First it is mentioned, that the sumpter horse, which carried
the King’s bed on this occasion, failed, and not being able to proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
further, was left here. Also there were in his train two valets—grooms
of his bed chamber, with their horses and attendants—the King’s
falconer, with his hawks—and two carters and four sumpterers, who
carried the King’s wardrobe. All these accompanied his march no
further. It also appears that some coffers, containing certain sacred
relics, which accompanied the Court on all ordinary journeys, were left
at Bridgnorth on this occasion. One certainly would not have thought
it at all likely, that the King on this important expedition—pursuing
his Welch enemies in such eager chase—would have provided himself
before setting out with means for engaging in the less warlike sport of
hawking; or that he would have thought of any kind of pastime, when he
had such weighty business on hand. And when his sumpter men and horses,
so well laden, halted at Bridgnorth, it must have somewhat astonished
the loyal people of the town, to see such large appliances and means
for the King’s amusement, under the perilous circumstances of the times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>It was more however in character with this King, that he should have
brought along with him in his march the religious relics above referred
to; and that he should have given directions for them to be treated
with superstitious reverence. A document is extant, which shews that
over these, during the three days that they remained at Bridgnorth,
wax candles were burnt at the King’s expense.—(<i>Antiquities of
Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 269.</i>) In King John, as in the case of many
others, there was a strange combination of the most immoral principles,
nay, of the most criminal passions, with the strictest regard to
superstitious observances. At the very time that he was pursuing a
course of wickedness, which made his name hateful to his subjects, he
was practising severe austerities on himself, which he would not allow
himself to omit, without making atonement for the neglect,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and going through a round of rites and ceremonies, with all the zeal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
an earnest devotee. It was but a short time after his visit to Bridgnorth,
where he had observed this childish ceremony of illuminating these
relics with wax candles—supposing he was thereby offering to God
acceptable service—that he committed that merciless act of cruelty in
the town of Nottingham, of sentencing to death thirty-two of the Welch
hostages, which had been delivered him at the late peace; and such an
eager desire for vengeance did he manifest on the occasion, that he
would not taste of food till he was assured that the bloody deed was done.</p>

<p>King John was again at Bridgnorth, two months after the memorable event
of his signing <i>Magna Charta</i>. This great constitutional charter of
England’s liberties the Barons had compelled the King to grant; but the
faithless monarch no sooner thought that he could do so with impunity,
than he revoked it; the Pope acting as an accomplice of his perfidy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
by absolving him from his oath. This threw the kingdom into a state
of universal confusion, and civil war raged from one end of it to the
other. It was about this time that the Burgesses of Bridgnorth began to
fortify their town with a wooden rampart, (a caution suggested no doubt
by the troubles of the time) and a large allowance of timber from the
Forest of Morfe was made to them for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Historians give a dreadful picture of the state of the nation at
this period. The King having levied a band of mercenaries, commenced
hostilities against his own subjects, and marching through the whole
extent of his kingdom laid waste the provinces on each side of him, and
by fire and sword made as wide a devastation in England as if it had
been an enemy’s country. It was towards the close of this destructive
progress, and about two months before his death, that King John visited
Bridgnorth for the last time. During his short stay of two days he
issued several charters, and then proceeded to Worcester, afterwards to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Gloucester, and from thence to Newark; where—either from the pressure
of extreme fatigue, or great anxiety of mind, or as some naturally
enough suppose, from the effects of poison—this unhappy monarch died,
and “freed his kingdom,” as the historian well observes, “from the
dangers to which it was equally exposed, by his success, or by his
misfortune.” [<i>Hume, Vol. 2, p. 92.</i>]</p>

<p>In the reign of his son and successor Henry III., Bridgnorth was as
frequently honored by a royal visit, as it had been in the previous
reign. Henry III. had frequent occasion to come into Shropshire, on
account of the dispute which had arisen between him and Llewelyn,
Prince of Wales: sometimes for the purpose of entering into
negotiations with him, and sometimes for the purpose of repelling
his incursions by force of arms. It was on one of these occasions,
September 1st, 1226, that the King, who had just left Bridgnorth,
issued a royal edict at Kidderminster—one not of any historic
interest, but of great local value; and one which the people of
Bridgnorth, and of the neighbourhood, are glad at this day to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
advantage of—viz: an edict which established St. Luke’s Fair in
this borough. It ran in these words, “The King grants, till he come
of age, that the men of Bruges may have an annual fair, to last for
three days—viz: the vigil, the day, and the morrow of St. Luke the
Evangelist.”—[<i>Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 302.</i>] So that
those who assemble at this annual mart of butter and cheese, to make
their purchases for the winter, may bear in mind that they do so in
virtue of a royal edict passed in the thirteenth century, and that the
fair which they keep is consequently of more than six hundred years
standing.</p>

<p>In the month of April of the following year, 1227, King Henry renewed
to the Burgesses of Bridgnorth the Charter<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
which had passed the Great Seal in the previous reign; but on the
20th of June in the same year, he granted them a totally new one,
which differed from the original charter principally in this, that it
conferred on the Corporation the fee-farm of Pendlestone Mills, or,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
as they are now called, “The Town’s Mills.” The clause in the charter
which made over this property to the Corporation of Bridgnorth, is
as follows:—“Moreover we have granted to our aforesaid Burgesses,
that they and their heirs may hold in fee-farm for ever our Mill at
Pendlestone, without the town of Bruges, upon the river Wurgh, with
suit of the town of Bruges, and all other its appurtenances; rendering
therefore to us and to our heirs yearly, by their own hand, at our
Exchequer £10—viz: at the feast of St. Michael, one hundred shillings,
and at Easter, one hundred shillings.”—[<i>Antiquities of Shropshire,
Vol. 1, p. 303.</i>] In virtue of this clause in the ancient charter
of Henry III, the Town’s Mills are the property of the Borough, the
Corporation being the Landlords of them, and the custom of paying a
yearly rent to the Crown is still continued.</p>

<p>In the year 1265 Bridgnorth was visited by King Henry, and his gallant
son Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I, on a very memorable occasion,
and one connected with events of such historic interest that it
deserves particular notice. The reign of Henry III was greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
disturbed by the rebellious proceedings of Simon de Montfort, son of a
well known Italian nobleman of that name, who had rendered himself so
famous by his cruel crusades against the Albigenses. Simon de Montfort,
the younger, came into England to take possession of the estates, which
his father had left him, about the middle of Henry’s reign, and he
was graciously received by the King; but although the King shewed him
many favors, and united him in marriage to one of the royal family,
he soon raised a rebellion against him, and threw the kingdom into
the same state of miserable confusion, which prevailed during the
previous reign. In a successful battle, which he fought at Lewes, he
got possession of the persons of the King and Prince Edward, and in
consequence became virtually master of the whole realm. But during
this eclipse of the King’s fortunes Shropshire faithfully adhered to
the royal cause, and maintained throughout this disastrous period its
character for loyalty.</p>

<p>Among the Barons, who proved their fidelity to the King’s declining
cause, the Constable of Bridgnorth, Hamo de Strange, was pre-eminent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
He held the Castle in spite of de Montfort’s imperious summons to
surrender; and though repeatedly commanded by the usurper in the
King’s name to yield, and to leave the kingdom, he bade defiance to
the mandate, and bravely maintained his post, till the great victory
at Evesham over the rebels restored the monarchy.—[<i>Antiquities of
Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 285.</i>] In this famous battle Prince Edward, who
had a short time before escaped from the hands of de Montfort, led the
army of the Royalists, and by his consummate military skill, as well as
by his signal valour, completely routed the rebels. De Montfort, their
leader, observing the skilful disposition of the Prince’s forces, is
reported to have exclaimed, in utter despair of the fortunes of the
day, “The Lord have mercy on our souls, for I see our bodies are the
Prince’s.” These gloomy forebodings were fully verified. In the fierce
encounter, which ensued, De Montfort was slain with his eldest son,
and about a hundred and sixty knights, and many other gentlemen of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
party, and his army put completely to the rout, so that the Prince
was left undisputed master of the field. It was not long after
this memorable action, that the people of Bridgnorth, and their
loyal constable, had the high honor of receiving into their town
the King, the Queen, the gallant Prince, and other members of the
royal household. It appears from some ancient documents, that great
preparations were made for their reception on this occasion; and that
the grand victory of Evesham, which brought about the restoration
of the Monarchy, and the overthrow of a tyrannical usurpation, was
celebrated within our Castle walls with festive rejoicings.—[<i>p.
258.</i>] It also appears that the loyalty of the Burgesses during the
season of the adverse fortunes of the King, and the losses which they
had incurred in consequence, did not pass unnoticed. The King liberally
rewarded them. The official papers which attest this, allege as the
reason for the royal bounty “the losses which they [the Burgesses of
Bridgnorth] had sustained in the time when the kingdom was disturbed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and because they faithfully adhered to the King, and to Edward, his
son, in the time aforesaid.”—[<i>p. 309.</i>]</p>

<p>The wise and energetic measures, which Edward adopted, when he
succeeded to the throne, put an end to the civil dissensions by which
the kingdom had been so long distracted; and this circumstance, as well
as his having finally annexed the Principality of Wales to the British
crown, prevented the necessity of his making those military expeditions
into the border counties, which had been so customary in the reigns of
his predecessors. But Edward II. proved as feeble as his father had
been vigorous in his government of the kingdom, and the consequence
was, that in a short time after his accession the realm was disturbed
by a renewal of intestine feuds, and rebellion soon raged from one end
of the kingdom to the other. A second confederacy of the Barons against
the king, which was formed for the purpose of enforcing on him the
banishment of his favorites, the Despencers, took place in the year
1321, and this brought about another siege of Bridgnorth Castle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The circumstances which led to it were these:—The Earl of Baddlesmere,
who owed all his honors, and the largest part of his ample estates
to the bounty of the king, joined the factious Barons in their
rebellion, and, adding insolence to ingratitude, proceeded so far as to
countenance a great affront offered to the queen. She having occasion
to pass his Castle of Leeds, in Kent, desired a night’s lodgings within
its walls, and was refused admittance, and some of her attendants were
wantonly killed before the gate. Edward shewed more promptitude and
energy in revenging this wrong, than in any other action of his reign.
He marched immediately with some forces to Leeds Castle, which he took,
and executed the governor, and having secured Baddlesmere’s treasures,
pursued him to his estates in Wiltshire, and from thence, after a
while, to his estates near Shiffnal. The confederate Barons, taking
alarm at the victorious progress of the King, assembled their forces to
besiege Bridgnorth. They burnt part of the town and took the Castle, in
the hope, that being masters of this important post, they would be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to check the further advance of the royal army. But they did not long
keep possession of it. The King came here in person at the head of his
army, and after a brief siege retook the fortress from the rebels, and
from thence marched in triumph to Shrewsbury, where the Burgesses, to
grace the triumph of their sovereign, came forth to meet him, clad
in armour, and where the chiefs of the insurgent Barons, the two Mortimers,
were obliged, as humble supplicants at his feet, to sue for mercy.</p>

<p>Five years after the date of this triumph the King was here again, but
under very different circumstances. The aspect of his fortunes had
become completely clouded, and the hopes, that had flushed his breast
as he crossed the Severn in pursuit of his discomfited enemies, were
exchanged for bitter disappointment and anxious forebodings; and he
entered our Castle on this occasion, not as a victorious general, or an
acknowledged king, but as a fugitive and an outlaw, on whose devoted
head a price was set. His faithless Queen, who added political treason
to private criminality, had joined in a conspiracy with Mortimer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
other disaffected Barons, and had summoned a parliament for the purpose
of deposing her husband. The act of deposition was easily passed. The
king was virtually dethroned, and feeling, as well he might, that his
life was in jeopardy, he anxiously looked out for some place of refuge,
where he might remain in safety till his friends brought him succour;
and judging from its position and its strong natural defences, that
Bridgnorth Castle would afford him a secure retreat, he took refuge
in it. This circumstance is recorded by an ancient historian,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
who mentions that in this dangerous crisis of his affairs, when he had
reason to dread personal violence from his enemies, the unhappy monarch
resolved to betake himself to some well fortified place, where he might
be safe till his friends should send him succour; and that he chose
Bridgnorth as admirably adapted to the purpose. Therefore, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
nightfall, he left his place of concealment, wherever that may have
been, and entered into a small boat with a few of his attendants,
and having crossed the Severn took refuge in our Castle. How long
our loyal fortress shielded him from the conspirators is not known;
but, after a time, they discovered his retreat, and dragged him from
it—took him prisoner first to Kenilworth, thence to Berkley Castle, in
Gloucestershire. The sequel is well known to every reader of English
history. After suffering from those, in whose custody he was placed,
every kind of indignity and insult which their malice could heap on
him, he died under the hands of merciless assassins, whom they hired to
despatch him, a death of extreme torture.</p>

<p>Such was the catastrophe which closed the reign of Edward II.—a reign
so signalized by troubles, and so saddened by the personal sorrows of
the sovereign, as well as by public calamities, that the affecting
words, which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of one who after a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
time was the successor both of his honors and of his misfortunes, might
well have been adopted by Edward as his own:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In Winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire</span>

<p>It must add to the interest with which we regard the remaining ruin of
our Castle, to reflect that when its walls and battlements were still
standing, it afforded shelter to the unhappy Edward in his hour of
need; and that Bridgnorth was the last place in his realm, where he
received the homage due to royalty, even in ruins.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS.</h3>

<p>It is now time to turn the attention of the reader to the Churches,
and other ecclesiastical establishments, which existed in former times
in the Borough of Bridgnorth. They were of great antiquity. The most
ancient of them was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_055" name="P_055">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_055.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="461" />
    <p class="center">The Church of Saint Mary
            Magdalene.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This Church originally stood within the walls of the Castle, and was
a Collegiate Church, the members of which were five Prebendaries and
a Dean. “The which Deanery and Prebends,” to quote the words of John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Brompton, “the King indeed conferreth of his own right and custom;
although in nearly all other Collegiate Chapels the Deans, being
installed by the Sheriff at the King’s collation, and inducted into
corporal possession of the Deaneries, confer all Prebends in the same
Chapels, and install, induct, and visit the Prebendaries. But in the
aforesaid Chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene, the Dean confers no Prebend,
nor visits Prebend or Prebendary; but each in the corps of his own
Prebend, hath and exerciseth plenary jurisdiction, as well in things
spiritual, as in things temporal;” so that it was in an especial sense
a Royal Chapel; and the whole ecclesiastical district connected with
it, and subject to its Prebendaries, bore the title, which it still
retains, of <i>The Royal Peculiar and Exempt Jurisdiction of the Deanery
of Bridgnorth</i>. It was first founded, as has been already noticed,
at Quatford, and from thence transferred, with all its rights and
privileges, and the chief part of its endowments, to Bridgnorth, in the
latter part of the reign of William Rufus, or early in the reign of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
successor; so that it is a very ancient foundation—nearly seven
hundred and fifty years old.</p>

<p>The privileges connected with it were considered very important, and
were guarded with the strictest jealousy from all encroachments, not
only by the members of the chapter, but by the Crown. So much was
this the case, that in the year 1241, when some delegates of the Pope
attempted to levy contributions in the Deanery of Bridgnorth, as well
as elsewhere, for the See of Rome, they were opposed, as interfering
with the prerogatives of the Royal Peculiar; and this opposition the
Pope himself was obliged to sanction and ratify; for on the complaint
of the King, he issued two Bulls at Lyons, in which he recognises
the rights of the King’s free Chapel at Bridgnorth, and forbids all
attempts made to levy procurations from it.</p>

<p>The Deanery of Bridgnorth at this time was held by Peter de Rivallis,
of whom (although his course reflected no honor on his sacred calling)
it may be well to take a passing notice, inasmuch as his name stands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
connected, not only with the early history of Bridgnorth, as being
Dean of the Peculiar, but with some of the important events in the
reign of Henry III. Peter de Rivallis was born at Poictou, and through
the influence of his uncle, the Bishop of Winchester, was introduced
into the English court, and was made Treasurer of the Chamber in the
King’s Household. He soon became a great favorite with his master, who
invested him, notwithstanding his clerical calling, with all the Royal
Castles in Shropshire. The confidence placed in him was unbounded, and
the favors heaped upon him almost without a parallel; for while he was
Dean of Bridgnorth and Constable of the Castle, a grant was made to
him of the Shrievalties of Shropshire and Staffordshire for life; also
of the counties of York, Berks, Gloucester, Somerset, Dorset, Devon,
Lancaster, Northumberland, Essex, Hants, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk, and
Kent. These, and such like favors, profusely heaped upon his foreign
courtiers, tended to alienate the minds of his English subjects from
the King, and were specially resisted by Richard Marshall, Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Pembroke. He and other English nobles entered into a confederacy with
Llewelin, Prince of Wales, and laid waste the county of Salop to a
considerable extent; and carrying their forage as far as the gates
of Shrewsbury, pillaged and burnt part of the town. This illustrious
nobleman who is called by ancient historians “the flower of chivalry,”
and who was more than a match for his enemies in the field, was at last
cut off by a base act of treachery, in which the Dean of Bridgnorth
bore the chief part. He, with others, forged a letter, as if sanctioned
by the King, and sent it to Ireland, announcing the forfeiture of the
Earl’s Irish estates, and promising a partition of them amongst those
who would arrest his person. This document however was not sufficient
to satisfy the Irish nobles, and they dispatched messengers, requiring
the King’s sealed charter on the subject. Peter de Rivallis forged the
required document, and attached the great seal to it; and the plan
completely succeeded. The Earl’s Irish possessions were invaded; in
consequence of which he crossed the Channel in order to protect them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
but in a skirmish, after having manfully maintained his ground against
fearful odds, he fell mortally wounded; and died in the hands of his
enemies, subjected in his last moments to every species of cruelty and
insult.</p>

<p>For this murder of the noble Earl of Pembroke (for it was nothing
less) the Dean of Bridgnorth was arraigned before the King and his
Justiciaries. He appeared on this occasion strangely habited for an
ecclesiastical dignitary; for he wore a corslet underneath his clerical
garment, and had a dagger suspended from his girdle, and appeared half
soldier, half priest. The King, assuming an appearance of anger which
he did not feel, for he secretly rejoiced at the death of the Earl,
accosted the Dean in very furious language, calling him a traitor, and
accusing him of having entered into plots which had brought damage and
disgrace on his kingdom. The Dean was sentenced to be committed to the
Tower; and when he pleaded his clerical orders, as a reason why he
should not be given up to the custody of a layman, the King answered,
reasonably enough, that he had always demeaned himself as a layman, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
as a layman he was now required to give an account of his stewardship:
and forthwith gave orders that all his lay possessions should be
confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
His name certainly confers no honor on the Royal Peculiar of
Bridgnorth, of which he was Dean; but I thought it well to give this
brief sketch of his history, as reflecting the manners of the age in
which he lived, and as shewing in a very striking way the miserable
condition in which the Church was sunk at that period. It was not then
as it was afterwards, in Puritan times, when, according to the lively
author of <i>Hudibras</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,</span>
<span class="i4">Was beat with fist, instead of a stick.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sharper and more formidable weapons were wielded in those days by men
in holy orders, and wielded at times to some purpose. It was doubtless
a sad perversion of the right order of things, when soldiers in
Cromwell’s army took upon them the office of divines; but it was a far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
worse perversion, when divines became soldiers—when the tonsure was
covered with a plumed helm—when Bishops and Deans, like this famed
Dean of Bridgnorth, hid a coat of mail underneath their cassock, and
wore a dagger at their girdle—when Dignitaries of the highest rank,
as was not seldom the case, led out armies to the field, and, sword in
hand, mingled in the thickest of the fight.</p>

<p>But the case above referred to, of Peter de Rivallis, is not the only
one, which affords evidence of the existence of such a state of things,
in early times, in the Deanery of Bridgnorth. In the reign of Edward
III, one Henry De Harley, upon a false report of the death of the Dean,
Thomas de Eyton, obtained a grant of the Deanery from the king. Thomas
de Eyton however making his appearance some time afterwards in the
King’s presence, the grant to De Harley was of course withdrawn, and a
special mandate given for restoring the rightful Dean. But the ejected
Dignitary, not willing to resign the benefice so easily, flew to arms,
resolved to support his claim at any cost. His opponent was equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
vigorous in the measures which he adopted for the establishment of his
rights. They both raised a body of armed men, in order to decide the
matter in dispute by the sword; nor was the unseemly strife put an end
to, but by the interposition of the sovereign. (<i>Dukes’ Antiquities of
Shropshire, p. 49.</i>)</p>

<p>But about this time there was one connected with the Collegiate Church
of Saint Mary Magdalene of Bridgnorth, whose name would cast a lustre
on any church in any age; and it is pleasant to turn from these
indecent scenes of ambitious strife among ecclesiastics, to contemplate
a character so truly exalted as his. The individual, to whom I refer,
was one whose influence on the Church and State was very considerable
in his day, having been twice entrusted with the Great Seal of England,
both in the reign of Edward III. and Richard II; and Bishop of one of
the most extensive dioceses in the kingdom—yet one, whose virtues were
more eminent than his rank or talents, and to whom, it should be added,
the Church of England owes more, perhaps, than to any other individual,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
for the sound and learned education of her clergy—the memorable
William of Wykeham. He was Prebendary of Saint Mary’s<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
in the year 1360; and it is no little honor to our town, that the name
of this great and good man is thus connected with it. This may justify
my introducing here a few particulars respecting him; for it seems
desirable that none of the readers, for whom these pages are chiefly
intended, should be unacquainted with one who was by far the most
illustrious person ever connected with the Collegiate Church of Bridgnorth.</p>

<p>Wykeham, early in life, before taking orders, was introduced into the
Court of Edward III., and recommended himself to the King by his great
skill in architecture. He was made surveyor of his works; and to him it
is chiefly that the Royal Family of England are indebted for by far the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
noblest of their palaces—Windsor Castle. He grew into such favour
with his sovereign, that he heaped preferments upon him, both civil
and ecclesiastical, till at length he advanced him to the important
See of Winchester. In the government of his Diocese he was a great
reformer, and most zealously set himself to correct the ecclesiastical
abuses which he discovered; and by the purity of his own life, as well
as by the strict and vigilant discipline which he exercised, brought
about a great improvement in the condition of the clergy. Through the
royal bounty, wealth flowed in on him in great abundance; but he was
only intent on finding channels for the useful distribution of it. His
munificence was unbounded, so that it is doubtful whether any sovereign
Prince ever expended so large a revenue on others, as he did in his
public and private charities.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Among other works, which attest the largeness of his heart in this respect, may be mentioned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
maintaining twenty-four poor persons in his own family—his building
and restoring churches, and erecting residences for his clergy, at
his own expense—and his rebuilding at an immense cost the nave of
his own Cathedral Church at Winchester, which stands at this day a
noble monument, not only of his princely munificence, but of his
architectural taste; for there are few ecclesiastical buildings in
England that equal it in dignity and grandeur. But the chief works
which have rendered his name illustrious as a benefactor, are the
building and endowing two noble Colleges, one at Winchester, and the
other in Oxford; the former of which he designed as a nursery for
the latter. These he enriched by very large and liberal endowments,
and enriched them still more by the treasures of wise counsels and
wholesome laws which he introduced into the statutes, which are so
admirable—“drawn up with such judgment and reach of thought,” as
Collier observes, “that they have been transcribed for the benefit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
other houses; and served as it were as a pattern to the principal
Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge;” (<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, <i>Book</i>
<span class="smcap">vii</span>, <i>p. 270</i>) so that it is no hazardous assertion to make,
that no one person in modern or ancient times has done more—perhaps
none so much—for the sound education of the clergy of England as
William of Wykeham, some time Prebendary of St. Mary’s, Bridgnorth.
At this very time, after the lapse of nearly five hundred years,
Bridgnorth is receiving the benefit of his noble institutions; for the
present Head Master<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
of Bridgnorth Grammar School is a Wykehamite, taught, and trained, and
nurtured in Winchester and New College. His fitness for the important
post he at present occupies, he owes, in part at least, to William
of Wykeham: so that whatever Wykeham in ancient times received as
Prebendary in the Deanery of Bridgnorth, he is now paying back to its
inhabitants, in the good instruction which is given to their children
in Bridgnorth Grammar School.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Church of Saint Leonard.</i></h3>

<p>The other Church of Bridgnorth, Saint Leonard’s, is, in all
probability, nearly as ancient in its foundation as Saint Mary’s.
No document exists which gives us the exact date of its foundation,
but there is reason to believe it is coeval, or nearly so, with the
foundation of the Borough; for Leland, who visited Bridgnorth in the
reign of Henry VIII., states that Saint Leonard’s was the sole Parish
Church of the town; and as it is not to be supposed that so important a
Borough would have been without a Parochial Church even in its infancy,
a very early date must be assigned to it. Mr. Eyton, who suggests this
strong argument for the antiquity of its foundation, subjoins to it
however the remark, that “as yet no architectural evidence occurs to
strengthen this assertion.” But he was not aware, when he made this
observation, of the fact, that in making some repairs in the chancel, a
few years since, the workmen came upon a stone carved with a moulding
which is supposed to be of Norman character; affording very probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
evidence that the building, of which it was a part, belonged to the
early period to which Mr. Eyton refers.</p>

<p>The earliest written notice which can be referred to respecting St.
Leonard’s, though it implies the pre-existence of the Church, cannot
itself be ascribed to an older period than the middle of the thirteenth
century. It occurs in a legal document, and is as follows:—“Roger,
son of Richard Irish, (Hybernensis) sells to Walter Palmer, for 6s.,
a rent of 6d., issuing from certain field-land without the cemetery
of Saint Leonard, which land William Sholton held of the Vendor, by
the same rent.” (<i>Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 341.</i>) It is
also ascertained from existing documents, that two chantries, or side
chapels, were set up in Saint Leonard’s; the one in the time of Edward
II, the other in the time of Edward III. This latter was founded by
William de la Hulle, who “assigns his messuage in Bridgnorth, (lying
between the conduit and a tenement belonging to Richard Brown) also
thirty acres of land, and sixty shillings there, to three chaplains,
who were to pray daily in the Church of Saint Leonard’s, for the souls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of his father and mother, and for his own soul, and those of his two
wives and children.“ (<i>Dukes’ Antiquities</i>, <span class="smcap">xxxvii</span>.)
I cannot but think that there still exists in Saint Leonard’s Church some
remains of one of these ancient chapels. In the south wall of the nave
there may be seen a Piscina, about six feet above the level of the
present floor: the height of it proves that the wall, in which it is
placed, formed part of a former structure, the floor of which must have
stood a good deal higher than the present one, for the usual height of
a Piscina from the ground was about two or three feet. A Piscina also,
it is to be noticed, was an appendage to an altar, and was never built
but in connection with one; so that there must have been an altar,
and consequently a chapel, in this part of Saint Leonard’s Church, of
which the present south wall formed a part; and we have no reason for
supposing this to be any other than that attached to the parish Church,
in the reign of Edward II, or Edward III.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_070" name="P_070">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_070.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="443" />
</div>

<p>John Leland represents Saint Leonard’s Church in his time
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1536) as one of great beauty, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
can be no doubt that originally it was a large and magnificent
building; for as late as the year 1645, when Symonds, an officer in
Charles’s army, visited Bridgnorth, it was still “a noble structure,”
ornamented with painted windows. He has given a sketch of the
figures on several of these. One of them, <a href="#P_070">here given</a>, was
that of an ancient Knight in armour, with his sword girded on his right thigh,
and his cross-shield painted beside him. It is supposed to be Adam
de Molineux,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
who lived in the reign of King Henry III.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Symonds also gives a description of some Altar Tombs, situate in the
north aisle (an aisle unhappily no longer in existence), on one of
which “lay a man in armour and a woman, with many painted escutcheons,
belonging to the Hoord family, of Hoord’s Park. Another in the same
aisle, the statue of a woman, fayrlie gilt, in alabaster, with this
inscription circumscribed, and coats of arms.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“HERE LYETH THE BODY OF</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The present Church of Saint Leonard’s, parts of which belonged no doubt
to the original building, forms, in the condition in which it now
stands, a sad contrast to the “fayre church” of John Leland’s time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Perhaps the future inhabitants of the town and of the surrounding
district, all of whom have more or less an interest in it, may feel an
earnest zeal for this house of God, and may possess the means as well
as the desire, of compleating the restoration of it, which was begun
a few years since, but was discontinued for want of funds. It is a
pity, even in an architectural point of view, to see it in its present
decayed condition; for it stands on as fine a platform, perhaps, as
any ecclesiastical building in England, and might be made, without any
considerable cost, both externally and within, a noble temple. Its
ancient Church Yard too, the burying place of so many generations, will,
it is to be hoped, ere long, be rescued from the dishonoured state
in which it lies. There sleep the dead of many centuries. A few feet
below the level of the present graves lie the remains of those, who
died in the period of the great Rebellion—some of them slain, perhaps,
fighting for what they deemed the cause of God, and of their country.
A few feet deeper rest the ashes of men, who were co-temporary with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Cranmer and Ridley, and who witnessed the progress of the glorious
Reformation. Deeper still lie those who died in the stormy times of
York and Lancaster. Lower still would be found the dust of those, who
belonged to the age of the great Plantagenets; and on a still lower
bed sleep those who lived when the sceptre of England was swayed by
Kings of Norman blood. Reverence then for the dead, who were buried
there ages long since, as well as reverence for those who have been
laid there in our own time, should make us anxious to see restored to a
higher degree of decency and order than at present marks its condition,
the ancient Cemetery of Saint Leonard’s Church.</p>

<p>I greatly regret that the historical notices of Saint Leonard’s Church
are so very scanty; for loving as I do, the very stones of the old
building, I should have been glad to associate it with any interesting
traditions of an early date. But these are wanting. However, in the
<i>Blakeway Papers</i>, in the Bodleian Library, there is preserved the
narrative of one incident that occurred in Saint Leonard’s Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
which is indeed worthy of a memorial. It is of too private a nature to
find its way into the page of history; yet, by those who are familiar
with the locality where it took place, and who find pleasure in the
manifestation of nobleness of disposition and magnanimity, even in the
youngest, it will not be read without interest.</p>

<p>The manuscript from which I copied it is as follows:—“Mr. Leighton
told me a story connected with this church, which is worth relating,
though I can assign no date or name to it. Two boys were at play in the
upper part of Saint Leonard’s Church, when some of the beams or joists,
on which they were standing, gave way. One of the boys had just time
to catch hold of the beams with his arms, and the other boy slipping
over his body caught hold of the other boys legs. There they hung for
some time calling for help: but no one heard them. At length the upper
boy said he could hold no longer. The lower boy said, “Do you think you
could save yourself if I were to loose you.” “Yes,” said the other, “I
think I could.” “Well then,” said he, “God bless you,” and loosing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hold was instantly dashed to pieces. The upper boy got up upon the
beams, and either climbed to a place of safety, or remained till some
one came to his assistance.” This was heroism of the noblest type; nor
did the knight in Roman story, who is described as leaping into the
gulph in the Forum, evince more true intrepidity of mind, or a more
generous spirit of self-sacrifice, than did this poor youth, when he
thus quietly loosened his only hold on life, to secure his companion’s
safety, and calmly wished him well in the name of God, as he was about
to make that fearful fall, which would indeed be life to his friend,
but inevitable death to himself. If his name were known, and the exact
spot where this affecting incident occurred, they would have been well
worthy of being put on record on a mural tablet, in Saint Leonard’s Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the Collegiate Church of Saint Mary Magdalene, and the
Parochial Church of Saint Leonard, there were several other religious
establishments in Bridgnorth, previous to the Reformation. But before I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
enter on any account of these, it is right that I should take a passing
notice of something far more ancient than any of them; which, though
standing within the parish of Worfield, is locally connected with our
town, and associated with its religious history—namely,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_077" name="P_077">&nbsp;</a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
On ascending the very steep hill, which leads out of the town towards
Wolverhampton, every one has observed, on the right hand side of the
road, a cave hollowed out of the sand-stone rock, which on examination
is found more extensive than might at first be supposed. This, there
is reason to believe, was in old time the solitary dwelling place of
one of the Saxon Princes, a brother of King Athelstan; and hither it
is believed he had fled, both that he might enjoy religious solitude,
and also screen himself from the violence and treachery to which his
Brother Edwin had fallen a prey. Documents are extant, which shew that
there was a Hermitage here in the reign of Edward III., under the
patronage of the Crown, and that it bore the name of Athelardestan—a
Saxon word, which signifies “the rock” or “stone of
Ethelward.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Thus documentary testimony supports the ancient tradition, that this
cave, amidst the seclusion of Morfe Forest, was the cell of a royal
anchorite—one who turned his back on the intrigues and fascinations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a court, and sought in this deep retirement a course of life more
congenial to his feelings. No doubt it was a mistaken sense of duty,
which made such men bury themselves in these dark solitudes; for it is
far nobler to encounter the world, and to overcome it, than to retire
from the conflict—better amidst its corruptions and cares, its trials
and temptations, to keep ourselves unspotted by it, than to seek an
escape from its evils by deserting the sphere of our appointed duties.
It is difficult for us, perhaps, to realize the position of serious and
peaceful minds in times of lawlessness and violence, yet at all times
the best exercise of self denial and mortification<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
is to be found in the common path of daily life—in intercourse with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
our fellow men—not in seclusion from them; and that must be a mistaken
piety, which seeks to please God by forsaking the responsibilities
of our station, and cutting ourselves off from the sympathies and
charities of life; still we must not scorn such piety, even though we
detect its errors, and lament its weakness; but willingly cherish the
hope, that its mistakes and deficiencies were pardoned by Him who is
not extreme to mark what is done amiss, and that many an occupant of a
solitary hermitage, like this of Ethelward, in the secret preference of
his heart, chose the good part which shall not be taken from him.</p>

<h3><i>Hospital of Saint John.</i></h3>

<p>We now come to consider the Ecclesiastical Establishments before
referred to, and first that which is usually called the Hospital of
Saint John, though it was also dedicated to the Holy Trinity and the
Virgin Mary. It was founded by Ralph de Strange, Lord of Alveley,
in the reign of Richard I. Such hospitals, though they became after
a while a refuge for the poor and destitute generally, yet were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
originally designed for the entertainment of travellers, and especially
of pilgrims, and therefore were built by the way side, that so they
might be as accessible as possible, and that the tired traveller might
not have far to go for rest and refreshment.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Saint John’s hospital was well situated for this purpose. Standing
within the angle formed by Mill Street and Saint John’s Street, it
commanded every highway by which travellers entered the town from
places lying eastward of the Severn. The roads from Quatford and
Claverley, and Worfield, and Shiffnal, all converging to a point on
that side of the Bridge, passed close to its gate; and no doubt many
a wayfaring man, wearied with threading his way through the mazes of
Morfe Forest was glad, when he had descended the hill, to rest under
its friendly roof.</p>

<p>The earliest royal recognition of this Hospital bears date March 9th,
1223. It is a mandate of Henry III., by which he directs Hugh Fitz
Robert, Forester of Shropshire, to give the Brethren of the Hospital of
St. John twelve cart loads of dry wood in Morf Forest. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
another, about two years later, by which King Henry III., being then
at Bridgnorth, commands the same Hugh Fitz Robert to allow the Master
and Brethren of the Hospital of the Holy Trinity of Bruges to have
three oak trees in Morf Forest for their fire, of the King’s gift.
There is also a record of a trial, which took place at the Assizes in
Shrewsbury, in the close of the same century, between the Crown and the
Prior of this Hospital, respecting some land in the parish of Alveley,
claimed by the Prior as part of the endowment of the establishment
by Ralph Le Strange. The claim was disputed by the King’s Attorney,
who set forth the royal title as by descent from Henry II. The Jurors
however found upon their oath, that “the Master had greater right to
hold the land as he held it, than the King to have it as he claimed
it.” The members of this Religious House were a Prior, or Master, and
several Lay Brethren; and the Mastership of it was in the reign of
Edward IV. annexed to the Abbey of Lilleshall.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Hospital of Saint James.</i></h3>

<p>This was an establishment of a very different kind. It was designed
only as a place of refuge for persons afflicted with severe or
contagious diseases, and was termed in legal documents <i>Domus
Leprosorum Jacobi</i>, or as <i>Maladria Sancti Jacobi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
It stood outside the town, east of the road which led from Saint John’s Hospital
to Quatford. Its founders were, probably, the community of the Borough
of Bridgnorth, and such an establishment may be considered as one of
the sanitary measures which they adopted for the benefit of the town.
Many of the large towns in England had establishments of this nature in
the thirteenth century; and there is evidence to prove, that the Leper
House of Saint James, in Bridgnorth, was founded previously to 1224;
for on the 22nd of September of that year, Henry III., who was then at
Bridgnorth Castle, issued the following mandate to Hugh Fitz Robert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
“Know that for the reverence of God, and for the health of our soul,
and the soul of the Lord King John our Father, we have granted to the
Leprous Brethren of the Hospital of Saint James, at Bruges, that they
may have one horse, daily plying in our Forest of Morf, to collect dry
stumps and dead wood for their fires, until we come of age.” There
is also a very early charter of the thirteenth century, now in the
possession of T. C. Whitmore, Esq., of Apley, bearing the Seal of the
Hospital of Saint James, by which it would appear that this society was
constituted without any superior of its own body, and that it acted
under the guidance, and with the consent of the good men of the town,
and that its members were of both sexes. (<i>Antiquities of Shropshire,
Vol. 1, p. 349.</i>)</p>

<p>These two establishments, the Hospital of Saint John and that of Saint
James, the one for the relief of the indigent, and the refreshment of
travellers, the other for the relief of diseased persons, were swept
away by the Act for the dissolution of Monasteries and Religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Houses, which passed in the reign of Henry VIII. What now answers to
these two in our town, are the Union Poor House and the Infirmary. I am
not about to institute a comparison between the modern institutions,
and those of olden times; and I most willingly bear testimony, that
the indigent and invalids, who are admitted into the Poor House and
Infirmary of Bridgnorth, receive the kindest and tenderest treatment;
at the same time we ought to be aware, that the ancient Religious
Houses of this Country, two of which were connected with our Borough,
afforded to the sick and needy substantial relief, and that, whatever
defects might belong to the system on which they were carried on,
they were for a time of essential service. Abuses did creep into them
no doubt—abuses of so flagrant a character, as called loudly for
reform—nevertheless, they afforded a shelter for houseless poverty,
a retreat for old age, and a refuge for disease, not to be found
elsewhere; and when a rapacious and mercenary law<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
decreed their dissolution, confiscated their property, uprooted their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
establishments, and swept them from the land, it left the poor unbefriended,
and subjected them to the severest sufferings, by casting them for relief
on the precarious supply that private charity afforded. The late
Professor Blunt, of Cambridge, in his valuable work on the Reformation,
gives the following description of the ancient Religious Houses, which
is as true as it is graphic. “They had been the Almshouses, where the
aged dependants of more opulent families, the decrepit servant, the
decayed artificer, retired as to a home, neither uncomfortable nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
humiliating. They had been the County Dispensaries, a knowledge of
medicines, and of the virtues of herbs, being a part of Monkish
learning. They had been foundling asylums, relieving the state of many
orphan and outcast children, and ministering to their necessities,
God’s ravens in the wilderness, bread and flesh in the morning, and
bread and flesh in the evening. They had been Inns to the wayfaring
man, who heard from afar the sound of the vesper bell, at once inviting
him to repose and devotion, and who might sing his matins with the
morning star, and go on his way rejoicing.” (<a href="#Page_141"><i>p. 141.</i></a>)</p>

<h3><i>The Friars.</i></h3>

<p>This was a House of Franciscan or Grey Friars,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
an order that was founded by Francis of Assisi, early in the thirteenth
century, and introduced into this country in the reign of Henry III.
About the middle of that reign, a branch of this fraternity settled in
Bridgnorth, and fixed their residence by the Severn side, on a site now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
occupied by Messrs. Southwell’s Carpet Manufactory. There they built
both a Friary and a Church. The great Hall, or Refectory, which
belonged to this establishment is still standing, and its oak-pannelled
ceiling and stone fire-place have not yielded to the wear of time, but,
after the lapse of six hundred years, are still in good preservation.
Some years ago, a few skeletons were dug up near this spot, and very
lately several others have been found; the place where they lay marking
out, no doubt, the situation of the Cemetery, which belonged to the
Church of the Friars.</p>

<p>There is a record of a curious trial at Shrewsbury Assizes, bearing
date 1272, which brings the Friars of Bridgnorth under notice. They
were charged with having enclosed the King’s highway on the bank of
the Severn, thereby damaging the King’s revenue. It was stated on this
trial, that “they take stones and rubbish from the bank of the Severn,
and throw them into the river, whereby they have realised to themselves
a piece of ground, one hundred and fifty feet long, and fifty feet wide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and this they have enclosed. By which process the bank causes the
water to pound upon the King’s Mills, the damage whereunto is five
merks per annum, and this was done sixteen years back.” I must leave
it to engineers to determine, whether or not there is any trace of
this artificial bank still remaining, and whether it is owing to
the construction of it, that the Eastern side of the river, near
Bridgnorth, is now so much more easily flooded than the Western: if so
the inhabitants of the Low Town owe a grudge to the Grey Friars of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>But some of the brethren of this community were, I doubt not, often
employed in much more important work than in banking up the Severn, and
gaining ground by encroaching on its channel. By the ancient seal of
their foundation, an engraving of which is given on the following page,
it may be seen that they were “<i>prædicatores</i>”—preachers. It was a
dark age in which they discharged this office, and some blessed truths,
which hold a prominent place in the system of the Gospel of Christ, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
unknown to them, or known very indistinctly. Nevertheless, many a
hooded Friar, in those days of darkness, did the best he could, with
the little light he had, to enlighten the ignorant around him; and He
who does “not despise the day of small things,” would not suffer his
labour to be altogether in vain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_090" name="P_090">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_090.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="403" />
</div>

<p>The Monks and Friars of former times have so bad a name among
Protestants, (and indeed there is too much reason for it) that it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
seem strange that I should express a hope, that the establishment of
this Friary of Franciscans in Bridgnorth, should have answered any good
purpose; yet I venture to do so. No doubt such establishments became
in later years exceedingly corrupt—almost as corrupt as those who
profited by their dissolution wished to make out. Often they harboured
evils within them of an enormous magnitude. Nevertheless, they at times
numbered among their members some most earnest and devoted servants of
our Lord, who, in the retirement of their closets, meditated devoutly
on His Word, and went forth from thence with a burning zeal to preach
it to others. In expressing an opinion, that piety of the highest order
might be found among the inhabitants of a cloister, however corrupt
the system may have been with which they were outwardly connected, I
am glad to be able to fortify myself by so great an authority, and so
unsuspected a witness, as Archbishop Leighton. His biographer states,
that although he was no friend to monastic seclusion, and regarded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
greater number of the regular Clergy of the Roman Catholic Church as
“<i>ignavi fures</i>,” yet at the same time “he recognized among them a
few specimens of extraordinary growth in religion; and thought he had
discovered in the piety of some conventual recluses a peculiar and
celestial flavour, which could hardly be met with elsewhere. Of their
sublime devotion he often spake with an admiration approaching to
rapture.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
On such a topic I cannot refrain from quoting also the following
striking passage from Dr. Maitland, whose acute and learned researches
into the state of religion in the middle ages, entitle his opinion
to the greatest weight. “I feel no doubt, that, in the darkest age,
there were many true and accepted worshippers of God. Not formed into
churches, and eminently bearing their testimony in corporate capacities
<i>as</i> churches, against the See of Rome (for then I think we should have
heard more about them); but as the sheep of Christ, dispersed abroad in
the midst of this naughty world—known, perhaps, by this or that name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of reproach—or, perhaps, the obscure and unknown, whose names were
never written anywhere but in Heaven. I doubt not that there were such,
living a life of faith and prayer and communion with God; overlooked in
the bustle of cities, and the solitude of cottages, and even shut up in
what some modern systems require us to consider as the strongholds of
Antichrist—the cell and the cloister. I will not shrink from avowing
my belief, that many a tonsured head now rests in Abraham’s bosom;
and that many a frail body, bowed down with voluntary humility, and
wasted with unprofitable will-worship—clothed in rags, and girt with a
bell-rope—was a temple of the Holy Ghost; and that one day—a day when
the follies of system, and the sins of party, and man’s judgment of his
fellows, will have come to an end—these, her unknown children, will
be revealed to the astonishment of a church, accustomed to look back
with a mixture of pride and shame to the days of her barrenness. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
may ask, ‘Who hath brought up these? Behold I was left alone; these,
where have they been?’—but she will have learned to know the seal of
the living God, she will embrace them as her sons, and will find better
matter of discourse, than their superstition and her illumination. In
the mean time, however, they are hidden—perhaps more completely hidden
than they need be, if due pains were taken to look after them, and gather
what might be known.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>We have happily an instance, to which, without going out of our way, we
can refer, in proof that the spirit of sincere and devoted piety may be
found in a monk or friar of ancient days. It is that of a Shropshire
monk of the twelfth century—Ordericus, the original historian of
our county, to whose records we are indebted for some of the facts
connected with the early history of Bridgnorth, related in the
foregoing pages. In the close of his history he subjoins an account of
himself, which breathes throughout a deep-seated humility, and ardent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
gratitude, which it would be well indeed if we, with our clearer views
and larger knowledge, could catch the spirit of. The whole of it is
well worthy a perusal, but I can only find room for the concluding
passage.</p>

<p>“Thus, thus, O Lord God, Thou who didst fashion me, and didst breathe
into my nostrils the breath of life, hast Thou, through these various
gradations, imparted to me Thy gifts, and formed my years to Thy
service. In all the places to which Thou hast led me, Thou hast caused
me to be beloved, by Thy bounty, not by my own deserving. For all Thy
benefits, O merciful Father, I thank Thee. I laud and bless Thee: for
my numberless offences, with tears I implore Thy mercy. For the praise
of Thy unwearied goodness look upon Thy creature, and blot out all
my sins. Grant me the will to persist in Thy service, and strength
to withstand the attacks of Satan, till I attain, by Thy grace, the
inheritance of everlasting life. And what I have prayed for myself, I
pray, O God, for my friends, and well-wishers. The same also I pray for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
all the faithful: and forasmuch as the efficacy of our own merits
cannot suffice to obtain those eternal gifts, after which the desires
of the perfect aspire,—</p>

<p>“O Lord God, Almighty Father, Creator and Ruler of the Angels, Thou
true hope, and eternal blessedness of the righteous, may the glorious
intercession of the Holy Virgin and Mother Mary, and all Saints, aid us
in Thy sight, with the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, Redeemer of all
men, who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the Unity of the Holy Ghost,
world without end.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The concluding passage of this prayer is slightly tinged with that
superstition, which afterwards appeared in a still more objectionable
form, and now so deeply stains the worship of the Church of Rome
with the foul blot of idolatry; but with Ordericus the evil was but
superficial, and though it does sully the beauty of his devotion, yet
it is not deep enough to hide its intrinsic piety. His godly sincerity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
is still conspicuous, notwithstanding the error with which it was
connected; for, as Milner well observes in his Church History, a
measure of superstition is compatible with real godliness. We may
hope that there were men of like spirit with Ordericus in the ancient
Friary of Bridgnorth, and if so, Christ was not without a witness here,
even in the darkness of the middle ages; and His holy name, though
pronounced by faltering lips, and a stammering tongue, would bring
salvation; and His truth, though taught obscurely and defectively,
would be sufficient to guide the feet of wandering sinners into the way
of peace, and to conduct the weary and heavy laden to their rest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The historical notices of Bridgnorth which I have thus brought before
the reader, will not, I hope, be considered wholly devoid of interest,
at least not by those who are locally connected with the place. They
are scanty indeed, but sufficient to shew them that the town, in which
it is their lot to live, not only is one whose foundation is of very
ancient date, and the Borough belonging to it one of the earliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in the kingdom, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, but that it has
been at times the theatre of events of some importance in history;
that the scenes with which they are daily familiar, and which are
now comparatively so quiet and peaceful, have again and again been
scenes of active warfare, where the besiegers and the besieged have
confronted each other in deadly combat, and where, on more than one
occasion, the Monarchs of England have appeared in person to vindicate
the prerogatives of their crown, and loyalty and rebellion have striven
valiantly and fiercely for the mastery. The rude hand of time has
indeed swept away almost every memorial of these things, and scarcely a
monument is left standing to mark the spot where they occurred; so that
they who take their customary walk around the Castle Hill, or stroll
along the towing path by the Severn side, see little or nothing to
remind them of the furious combats which once signalized these scenes.
The hill rises so peacefully in the midst of the valley, that it does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
not look as if it had ever been the object of a military assault, nor
is it easy to imagine, when we look on the gentle flow of the river,
that its waters were ever reddened by human blood. The contrast between
what now is, and what has been in other days, is so great, that the
beautiful lines which Sir Walter Scott has addressed to the Teviot,
might, with little alteration, be accommodated to the Severn:</p>

In the foregoing pages I have brought before the reader many historical
notices of Bridgnorth from a very early period down to the reign of
Edward III; but I regret that I have been able to collect only a very
few from the commencement of that reign to the era of the Reformation,
and still fewer between that period and the time of the Civil Wars; but
the few which I have been able to collect respecting these intervals,
though of minor importance, may not be without their interest, inasmuch
as they serve to connect our town, however slightly, with some of the
memorable events in English history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The reign of Edward III. is one of the most brilliant in the annals of
England. The military prowess of the nation, directed by the genius
and intrepidity of the King himself, and by the youthful heroism of
his son Edward, the Black Prince, acquired a fame which has never
since been eclipsed. This enterprising monarch had not been many years
on the throne before he invaded the territories of France, and there
obtained triumphs, so marvellous, when the superiority of the enemy’s
forces is considered, that the names of his victories, <i>Cressy and
Poictiers</i>, are “household words” with Englishmen, even in this day.
It is very possible that some of the men of Bridgnorth may have taken
part in these famous battles; for it appears from a public document,
that just before the invasion of France by King Edward, a writ was sent
to Bridgnorth, as well as to other towns in Shropshire, for raising a
small contingent to the war. In this document it is stated that “Sir
Roger de Strange of Knockin, John Aston and others, as chief persons
within the County of Salop, were summoned to raise 40 men at arms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
within the said County, and 30 Hobelers within the town of Salop; 10
Hobelers in Ludlow; 6 in Wenlock; 10 in Bridgnorth; 4 in Newport;
and 40 in the rest of the County.”—(<i>History of Shrewsbury, p. 163,
note 1.</i>) The <i>men at arms</i> were horsemen who wore a complete suit
of armour, and were mounted on strong war horses, answering to our
heavy dragoons; the <i>hobelers</i> were light-armed horsemen, who rode on
“hobbies,” or small fleet horses, and were in the armies of the ancient
English what the troops of light cavalry are in ours. They served the
same purpose for Edward in his French campaign that our light brigade
did for us in the famous charge at Balaklava. I do not know whether any
man from Bridgnorth was among those gallant 600; but I know that some
of our townsmen were exposed to other perils in the Crimean campaign,
and met them with a fortitude that did no dishonour to their ancestors,
who were enrolled under the banner of the Black Prince.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find out any other fact of any particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
interest respecting Bridgnorth, during the reign of Edward III, except
that the Burgesses of the town petitioned him, that they might have
the use of his chapel, within the Castle, as a parish church. Hitherto
this chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene had been exclusively allotted to
the Castle, and perhaps was used solely by the garrison, and Saint
Leonard’s was the only parochial church belonging to the town; but
now, the Burgesses wishing for larger church accommodation, on account
perhaps of the increase of population, or for some other cause which
made it desirable, laid their petition before the King, that he would
grant them the use of his royal chapel. Whether or not they succeeded
in their object does not appear.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>About twenty years after this, in the same reign, the population was
fearfully diminished by a pestilence, which twice swept over England,
as well as the rest of Europe, and which was so destructive in its
ravages, that it is computed that a third part of the inhabitants of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
every county was taken off by it. Shropshire suffered very severely.
We have no record of its progress in Bridgnorth; if we had, it would
doubtless afford us as many narratives of an interesting, though
painful, character, as the visitation of the cholera did a few years
since. This fact the historian Walsingham relates, that eighteen out of
every twenty in the Friaries and Abbeys fell victims to the disease.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
This may be in part accounted for by so many living together in
the same house, among whom a contagious disease would be likely to
spread with fatal rapidity. Others attribute the remarkable amount of
mortality among the ecclesiastics at this time<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
to their frequent visitations of the sick—their constant intercourse
with the diseased and dying. If this be a true account of the matter we
may infer that the members of the religious houses in Bridgnorth—who,
like their brethren elsewhere, perished in numbers—were thus charitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
employed during this visitation, and sacrificed their lives to this ministry
of mercy, imparting as far as they were able to do so, the consolations of
the Gospel of Christ to the sufferers around them.</p>

<p>On the death of Edward III., the reins of government were committed
into the feeble hands of Richard II., who, after a disastrous reign of
twenty-two years, (during which I find no historical notice of our town
worth mentioning) was deposed by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of
Lancaster. Henry, who assumed the sovereignty, under the title of Henry
IV, was frequently in Shropshire, on account of the insurrectionary
movements which took place among the Welsh, during the early part of
his reign. Under the leadership of the hot-headed and enterprising
<i>Owen Glendwyr</i>, they ravaged the border counties to a considerable
extent; and, in consequence of this, the Council issued an order,
that all the Castles on the borders—and Bridgnorth Castle was one of
them—should be strengthened and put in a state of defence, to resist
the incursions of the rebels. But previously to this, an act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Parliament had been passed, which had special reference to Bridgnorth,
with other towns in our County, forbidding them to allow any one
born in Wales, and descended from Welsh parents, to become a member
of their corporations, or even to purchase land within the Borough.
These restrictions, however severe they may appear, were considered
necessary, on account of the spirit of disaffection, which so generally
prevailed in the Principality.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding these civil enactments and military preparations,
the cause of the Welsh chieftain continued to gain ground, till it
suddenly received unexpected support, from the accession to his party
of the Duke of Northumberland, and his valiant son Harry Hotspur, who
at the head of a formidable army of English and Scotch, marched towards
the borders. He, as quickly as possible, united his forces to those of
Glendwyr, and the combined rebel army encountering the royal forces,
led on by the King in person, and Henry Prince of Wales, fought a great
battle, well known to the readers of English History as the famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
<i>Battle of Shrewsbury</i>; for it was fought under the walls of our county
town. If we may rely on Shakespeare in this matter, who indeed is
often, even in minute circumstances, an excellent historical authority,
we may conclude that Bridgnorth was the place appointed by King Henry
for the rendezvous of his army on the eve of this great battle. In
the first part of the Play of Henry IV, the king is represented as
addressing the chief leaders of his army, and giving instructions as to
the mustering of his forces, in these words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The Earl of Westmorland set forth to-day;</span>
<span class="i1">With him, my son, lord John of Lancaster;</span>
<span class="i1">On Wednesday next, Harry, thou shalt set forward;</span>
<span class="i1">On Thursday, we ourselves will march:</span>
<span class="i1">Our meeting is Bridgnorth: and, Harry, you</span>
<span class="i1">Shall march through Glostershire; by which account</span>
<span class="i1">Our business valued, some twelve days hence</span>
<span class="i1">Our general forces at Bridgnorth shall meet.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If our dramatist had any warrant for this representation, of which
I have no doubt, the town of Bridgnorth must have witnessed on this
occasion a fine military muster, and have had the privilege of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
receiving into its Castle one who has been ranked among the greatest
of England’s heroes—Henry, Prince of Wales. He was just at that time
beginning to emerge from the state of wild and thoughtless profligacy
in which he had wasted his early years, and was about to exhibit those
qualities, which have since made his name so illustrious in English
History. The battle of Shrewsbury, at which he did some service, was
very decisive; and the confederate army of the rebels, under Glendwyr,
Hotspur, and Douglas, was completely routed. Nevertheless our county
continued for years after to be ravaged by the Welsh insurgents, nor
was it till the reign of Henry V., when the death of Glendwyr took
place, that there was any security for life and property in the Borders.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reign of Henry VI. commenced that most destructive
series of Civil Wars, known by the name of the Wars of the Roses,
between the rival houses of York and Lancaster, which laid waste for
many years the fairest provinces of the land. “It was not finished in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
less than a course of thirty years: was signalized by twelve pitched
battles: opened a scene of extraordinary violence: is computed to have
cost the lives of eighty Princes of the blood, and to have almost
entirely annihilated the ancient nobility of England.”—<i>History of
Shrewsbury, Vol. 1, p. 166.</i></p>

<p>Shropshire was necessarily embroiled in these contests, and I have
lighted upon one fact, which shows, I think, that Bridgnorth, as well
as the neighbouring town of Shrewsbury, assumed the badge of the <i>White
Rose</i>, espousing the cause of the house of York. The fact referred to,
though a trifling one in itself, seems to me to connect Bridgnorth with
the great leader of that party—Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York. This
nobleman, who had doubtless a clearer title to the crown of England
than the reigning monarch, held the Castle of Ludlow, and was naturally
very anxious to associate the people of Shrewsbury with his party, and
to make them his adherents. He therefore entered into communication
with them; and on one occasion, when a matter of some consequence was
to be considered, the Bailiffs of Shrewsbury appointed a gentleman of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Bridgnorth, the representative of this Borough, in company with others,
to treat with the Duke at his castle of Ludlow. The following extract
from the accounts of the Bailiffs of Shrewsbury, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1457,
refers to this fact:—“Paid for a breakfast to Thomas Acton and Thomas
Hoord, for their good council, touching the return of a precept to the
Duke of York, directed to the Bailiffs for surety of the peace.” Again.
“Money paid for the expenses of Thomas Hoord, and William Lyster,
riding to the Lord Duke of York at Ludlow, to get the said precept
dissolved.” (<i>History of Shrewsbury, Vol. 1, p.</i> 224.) This Thomas Acton
was of Aldenham, and ancestor to the present baronet of that name; and
Thomas Hoord was of <i>Hoord Park</i>, now called Park Farm, adjacent to our
town, a gentleman of ancient lineage. He was member of Parliament for
our Borough, and therefore it is not likely that he would have engaged
himself to treat with the Duke of York, if he had not been aware that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
his constituents at Bridgnorth were well affected to his party, which
was now growing formidable.</p>

<p>I have not had access to any records which shew whether our town took
any very active part, or in what measure they suffered in consequence,
in this fatal and disastrous strife; but it is scarcely possible that
such great battles should have been fought in this and the adjoining
counties, as <i>Mortimer’s Cross</i>, <i>Tewksbury</i>, and <i>Ludlow</i>, without
Bridgnorth being more or less affected by them. I have little doubt
that the state of decay and ruin, in which parts of the town were found
some years afterwards, is to be traced to these civil contests. This is
noticed in an Act of Parliament, passed in the year 1535. It recites
that “many houses, messuages, and tenements of habitation, in the town
of Bridgnorth, now are, and have of a long time been, in great ruin and
decay, and specially in the principal and chief streets there being;
in the which chief streets in time passed have been beautiful dwelling
houses there, well inhabited, which at this day much part thereof is
desolate and void grounds, with pits, cellars, and vaults lying open and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
uncovered, very perilous for people to go by in the night, without
jeopardy of life, which things are to the great impoverishing and
hindrance of the said town.” (<i>History of Shrewsbury, Vol. 1, p. 318.</i>)</p>

<p>These wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, which spread such
ruin over the land, did not cease till after the battle of Bosworth
Field, and the accession of the house of Tudor to the throne, in the
person of Henry VII; and with this latter event, a very important one
in English history, Bridgnorth was accidentally connected.</p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham was the chief instrument of raising the Earl of
Richmond, afterwards Henry VII, to the throne of England, and this was
occasioned, the historian Hall relates,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
by a casual circumstance which occurred in the neighbourhood of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
town. This Duke had large estates in Shropshire, in consequence of his being the
representative of the ancient family of Corbet, and among these he had certain
tenements in Bridgnorth. (<i>Dukes’ Antiquities of Shropshire, p. 31.</i>)
His possession of this property was perhaps the cause of his visiting
our town, in the summer of 1483. It was just at this time that he was
plotting the overthrow of the government of Richard III, but feeling
uncertain as to the person whom he should endeavour to make sovereign
in his stead, when riding one day between Bridgnorth and Kidderminster,
he accidentally met the Countess of Richmond, better known by the name
of <i>the Lady Margaret</i>. This casual interview suggested to his mind the
young and enterprising Earl of Richmond, as the fittest heir to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
English throne; and he immediately set himself to raise an insurrection
in these, and other parts of the kingdom, in his favour. The
insurrection succeeded, though Buckingham himself perished in the
enterprise; and the Earl of Richmond, became Henry VII, king of
England. On so accidental a circumstance depended the accession of
the house of Tudor to the English throne, and the consequences, which
followed it, so important to the interests of this great empire.</p>

<p>It was during the sovereignty of the house of Tudor that one of the
most important events in the history of our country took place, viz.,
<i>the Reformation</i>, commencing in the reign of Henry VIII., and being
completed in that of Elizabeth. I greatly regret not having been able
to collect any information respecting our town during this eventful and
interesting period. One would like to know how it was affected by the
great movement which was then taking place, and whether the pulpits of
St. Mary’s and St. Leonard’s were late or early in announcing those
glorious truths, which at that time began to stir the depths of people’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
minds, and caused such a mighty revolution in the land—whether here,
as well as elsewhere, there were men who stood up as fearless defenders
of the truth, ready to seal their advocacy of it with their blood.
We have no details on the subject; but we learn that the spirit of
reformation was awakened in Shropshire as far back as the fourteenth
century. A very remarkable Poem of that date, entitled “<i>The Visions
of Piers the Ploughman</i>,” whose uncouth rhymes seem to have produced
a wonderful effect on the popular mind, was written by an inhabitant
of the neighbouring town of Cleobury Mortimer. (<i>History of Salop,
p. 202, note 1.</i>) We also know that our county town had a courageous
advocate of the cause in the reign of Henry IV in William Thorpe; who
ascending the pulpit of Saint Chad’s, vehemently denounced the errors
of the Church of Rome, and in consequence suffered imprisonment. It is
not likely that such things should have gone on in the neighbourhood of
Bridgnorth without our townspeople being more or less affected by them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
but we have no particulars—none, I mean, that my very limited search
could discover—respecting the progress which the Reformation made
among them.</p>

<p>There is one document, however, which shews that the accession of
Queen Mary was received by the inhabitants of Bridgnorth and its
neighbourhood with great demonstrations of joy; but it is of course
doubtful whether this resulted from their loyalty to the person of
one whom they rightly regarded as the heir to the throne, or from
attachment to those religious opinions of which she was known to be a
patron. The document I refer to is an extract from the Register of Sir
Thomas Boteler, Vicar of Much Wenlock, beginning November 26th, 1538,
ending September 20th, 1562. “1553 Memorandum. That as some say King
Edward VI, by the grace of God, &amp;c., died the 6th day of this instant
month of July, in the year of our Lord God as it is above written, and
as some say he died on the 4th of May last proceeding in the same year
of our Lord; and upon Mary Magdalene’s day, which is the 22nd day of
this instant month, at Bridgnorth in the fair there was proclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Lady Mary, Queen of England, &amp;c., after which proclamation finished,
the people made great joy, casting up their caps and hats, lauding,
thanking, and praising God Almighty, with ringing of bells, and making
of bonfires in every street. And so was she proclaimed Queen on the
same day, and at the Battle field in the same evening, with the like
joy of the people, and triumphal solemnity made in Shrewsbury, and also
in this Borough of Much Wenlock.”</p>

<p>The Act for the dissolution of Monasteries and other Religious Houses
took effect here of course, and consequently the <i>Friary</i> and the
Hospitals of <i>St. John</i> and <i>St. James</i> were all suppressed, and their
property confiscated. The Brethren of Grey Friars seem at that time to
have been in very reduced circumstances, so that the spoils obtained
from them were hardly worth the seizure. The King’s Commissioners came
here on the 5th of August, 1538, and the following note, which was
signed by the Bailiffs of the town, shows the indigent condition in
which this religious establishment was found—a plain proof of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 1210]</a></span>
little hold at that time the orders of monks and friars had upon the
affections of the people. “Memorandum. This V daye of Auguste, in ye
XXX yeare of Kynge Henry the VIIJth, that Rycharde bysehope of Dovor,
and vesytor under the Lorde Prevy Seale for ye Kynge’s grace, was in
Bryggenorthe, wher that the warden and heys Bredren in the presens of

<li class="isub1">(<i>Wright’s History of Ludlow, p. 342.</i>)</li>
</ul>

<p>An incidental proof of the state of penury to which these poor Friars
of Bridgnorth were reduced, may be gathered from a note kept among the
records of the town of Shrewsbury, of the expenses which were incurred
by Roger Thomas, their senior Bailiff, and Thomas Bromley, afterwards
Lord Chancellor, in a journey which they made from Shrewsbury to
Bewdley on important business. On their return they stopped at
Bridgnorth, and had their dinner at the principal inn, and this is the
note of their expenses:—“Dener at Bruggenorth 3s. 4d.; to Shepay the
frere 1d.” This Shepay was no doubt a member of the Grey Friars, who
waited upon the travellers at their inn, to beg alms for his house.
(<i>History of Shrewsbury, p. 302.</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been expected that when Queen Mary came to the throne
she would have restored all the religious houses in England to their
original use; but on the contrary, pressed by strong political motives,
she confirmed by her own acts the confiscation, which had been made in
the reign of Henry VIII., of the property belonging to them; and thus
under a Popish sovereign it became irrecoverably alienated from the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The Hospital of St. James, Bridgnorth, affords a striking example of
this. In the year 1566, the Queen, in conjunction with her husband
Philip, made over to Sir J. Parrott, in consideration of £184 15s.,
and for his faithful services, all the property belonging to this
Hospital.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
In the year following, Sir J. Parrott transferred the same to Mr.
R. Smith of Morville. In the following reign of Elizabeth, it was
transferred to William Tupper and Robert Dawes; and the property,
after passing through the various families of Smith, Dovy, Kinnersly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Nevitt, Tyner, and Bach, came into the family of <i>Stanier</i>, and now,
by another turn in the wheel of time, the name of <i>Smith</i> is again
connected with the property. There was an order in Council at one
time, that this estate should pay to Bridgnorth Church a yearly sum of
twenty nobles—equal to £6 13s. 4d. This order was lost out of the town
chest, and afterwards recovered; but in one of the wars it was burnt,
after which the property rendered nothing but a pound of frankincense
every Easter, to be burnt in the Church of the High Town: but this last
customary payment has long been discontinued.</p>

<p>What may have been the value of this pound of frankincense I do not
know, but whatever it may have been, it is certain that the Incumbents
of Bridgnorth receive from the present owners of St. James’s, in their
liberal support of the religious institutions of the town, something
far more valuable than this former impost upon their property.</p>

<p>We now enter on the era of Elizabeth. There is perhaps no period in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
history of our country to which Englishmen are accustomed to look back
with more satisfaction. Whatever may have been her faults and foibles
as a woman, she was undoubtedly a great Queen, and swayed the sceptre
of this realm with such a steady and vigorous hand, as made her revered
by her subjects, and dreaded by her enemies. She contributed more
perhaps than any sovereign that preceded her, to raise the character
of our country, and place it high in the scale of European nations.
Besides, she was under God, the great means of strengthening the cause
of the reformed faith, and resisting the colossal power of the Church
of Rome.</p>

<p>It would have been very gratifying to find any record which would have
connected the history of our town with the public events which took
place in the reign of this great princess; but I have not been able
to find any, none at least but what are of a very trivial nature. I
find, for instance, that in the singular proclamation which she issued,
for the purpose of compelling every one in her realm to wear <i>woollen
caps</i>, except the nobility, she mentions Bridgnorth, as a place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the company of cappers used to flourish;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
which seems to indicate that the people now enjoyed a considerable
share of quietness, and were acquiring wealth by their trade and
industry. Again I find that when her great favorite, the Earl of
Leicester, visited Shrewsbury, and where preparations were made to
receive him with an honour, little short of that which would have been
offered to the Queen herself, one of the three who were appointed to
address him on the occasion, was a Bridgnorth youth, Richard Hoord,
son of John Hoord, of Hoord Park; no slight distinction, considering
the almost royal dignity which was attached to the person of the Earl
of Leicester. But it is only in circumstances of this nature, and
not in matters of weightier import, that I can find any reference to
Bridgnorth in this reign. I ought not however to be disappointed at
this, for one who had far better opportunity for making researches of
this kind, than I have, and far greater aptitude for the task, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
stated that “from the 27th year of Henry VIII till the year 1629, he
could discover no historical notice of the Town or Castle of Bridgnorth.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>This latter date brings us to a very remarkable period in the history
of our town. In that year, viz, the 4th of King Charles I., and on the
2nd day of October, the King made a grant of the Castle, to Gilbert
North, Esq., one of the Gentlemen of the Privy Bed Chamber. It had been
a royal castle from the time that it was taken by Henry I. from Robert
de Belesme—a period of more than five hundred years. But now, perhaps
on account of the cost of keeping it in repair, it was transferred to
the possession of a gentleman belonging to the King’s household, who
by a subsequent deed of the same year, transferred it to Sir William
Whitmore, Knight, in whose family it has continued ever since.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
It is indeed greatly to be regretted that its present possessor should have
so small a remnant of it to call his own, and that the leaning tower on
Castle Hill, as it is popularly called, should be all that is left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of this once noble fortress of the middle ages. But how it came to
be thus reduced to utter ruin, is the subject which must now occupy
our attention; and it is one which is intimately connected with the
stirring events of that period.</p>

<p>At the time in which Bridgnorth Castle was transferred to the Whitmore
family, the nation was in a great state of political disquietude. The
King was disposed to carry his royal prerogative beyond the limit
which the law had assigned to it; and many members of the Houses of
Parliament in resisting the encroachment, were tempted to invade the
rights of legitimate authority, and became in the struggle fierce and
unrelenting enemies to the Crown. This contest of prerogative on the
one hand, and the spirit of liberty on the other, brought about the
Great Rebellion; and this fair land was once more destined to be the
scene of civil strife, in which was shed the best and noblest blood
of England. Of the two parties into which our countrymen were then
divided, the Royalists and Roundheads, it is not my province to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
much; I know to which of the two, had I lived at the time, my feelings
and principles would have attached me; yet I feel bound to acknowledge,
that while I regard some of the opinions and some of the acts of the
insurgent party with a feeling nothing short of abhorrence, there were
among them, both among their soldiers and their divines, men of the
highest character, and whose minds were cast in the finest mould; nor
am I unwilling to allow that England is in a great measure indebted to
this party for the present freedom of her institutions.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Respecting, however, the great leader of the party, Oliver Cromwell, I cannot
agree with some late writers, who have endeavoured to canonize his memory,
and who try to represent him as a pure and unselfish patriot. He was
indeed a man of great qualities, of fearless fortitude, and untiring
energy; and perhaps at the commencement of his public course he was
upright and single hearted in his intentions: but there can be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
question of it, that he became ambitious of earthly power; and the
religious phraseology, which was once perhaps the sincere expression of
his feelings, he afterwards employed as a crafty instrument to further
his designs, and to conceal their evil character.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Nor must we, if we would form a just estimate of him, lose sight of the
fact that while he was a subject he was an enthusiast on the side of
liberty, but when he himself was placed on the seat of power, no Stuart
or Plantagenet was ever more despotic in his rule.</p>

<p>In this great intestine struggle, the inhabitants of Bridgnorth, as
was natural from their hereditary loyalty, espoused heartily the cause
of Charles I., as that of their legitimate sovereign; and suffered
severely for their allegiance. In the year 1642, preparations were made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
throughout the country for the commencement of hostilities; and in
consequence, the authorities here thought it necessary to put the town,
as far as possible, in a state of defence: and the Corporation have
still in their possession some interesting records, containing the
Common Hall orders which were made on this occasion. The first is as
follows:—Bridgnorth. At a Comon Hall in the said towne, the XXVI day
of August, Aᵒ. R. Caroli Angl, &amp;c., XVIIIº Aᵒ Dⁿⁱ 1642, John Harryson
and Robert Richards, Gents, being Bailiffs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Concerninge the makinge of a draw Bridge upon the Bridg over
Severn in Bridgnorth aforesaid, and other things for the defence of
the said towne, upon a warrant from John Weld, Esq., High Sheriff of
this county of Salop, in respect of the extreame danger which is
now come neare unto us.</i></p>

<p>It is agreed, That the makinge of a draw Bridge shall be respited
untill further consideration; and that for the present necessity, Posts
and Chaines shall be made at the two ends of the Low Towne, viz., At
the farther end of the Mill Strette, and at the farther end of St.
John’s Streete, and at other needfule places in the said Towne; and
also that the Gates of the said Towne shall be repayred, and made
stronge with chaynes and otherwise, as shall be convenient for strength
and defence of the said Towne.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
But very early in the year, the Bailiffs had projected another means of
defence. They had petitioned Thomas Corbett, Esq., of Longnor, in this
county, to exercise the young men of the town, and of the immediate
neighbourhood, in the practice of arms and military tactics, that so
they might be ready to repel any attack which might be suddenly made
by the rebel forces. The following is the letter which Mr. Corbett
addressed to Sir Francis Ottley, Governor of Shrewsbury, on this occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“1642. Noble Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&emsp;The Bayliffs of Bridgnorth, in behalf of the town, having been
importunate with me to take upon me the exercising of the young men in
this town, and others in the country neare adjoining, for the defence
of the towne upon any needfull design, I have been persuaded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
them to take the same upon me; and they having shewn me a letter which
they intend to present unto the high Sheriff, for a warrant unto me in
that behalf, I pray be pleased to consider thereto, and impart your
advice unto me, and further Mr. Sheriff’s directions therein, as you in
your wisdom shall think most convenient, and you will oblige</p>

<p>Your respective kinsman,<br />
<span class="ws3">and friend who truly</span><br />
<span class="ws5">Honoureth you,</span><br />
<span class="ws7"><span class="smcap">Thos. Corbett</span>.</span></p>

<p>Bridgnorth, 5 Feb., 1642.</p>

<p>To my noble friend and kinsman Sir Francis Ottly, Knight, at
Shrewsbury House.” (<i>Blakeway Papers, Bodleian Lib.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>No time indeed was to be lost, for four days before the date of
the order above referred to, the King had set up his standard at
Nottingham, and the parliamentary forces were in the field, under the
command of the Earl of Essex. On the 20th of the following month, the
King removed into this county, and Clarendon states, that “a more
general and passionate expression of affection cannot be imagined, than
he received by the people of Shropshire, or a better reception than he
met at Shrewsbury.” (<i>History of the Rebellion, Vol. 2, p. 18.</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
But on his march thither he heard of the rebel army advancing towards
Worcester, and in order to watch their motions, and if possible to
check their progress, he dispatched his nephew Prince Rupert with all
his horse across the Severn; and it was most likely on his return
from this expedition, that the Prince passed through our town, and
took up his residence for the night at <i>Cann Hall</i>. He had conducted
the expedition with that intrepid gallantry which characterized all
his military movements; he had with a handful of men attacked a large
body of the enemy as they were defiling out of a narrow lane near the
city of Worcester, and completely routed them in the first onset,
slaying several of their number, and taking the commanding officer
prisoner; (<i>History of the Rebellion, Vol. 2, p. 25</i>) so that he came
to Bridgnorth, flushed with the first victory which was gained in
these civil wars. While he was here he addressed a letter to the Jury
appointed to choose a Bailiff, dated September, 21st, 1642. It is as follows:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot space-above1">
<p>You Gentlemen of the Jury, who are to have voices in this election,
these are to entreat you, out of a tender care both of his Majesty’s
service and your own happiness and welfare, that in the present
election you make choice of such men for your Bailiffs as you are sure
are well affected for his Majesty’s service. By which you will oblige
me to remain,</p>

<p class="author">Your Loving Friend,&emsp;&nbsp;<br /><span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The Bailiffs chosen were Thomas Dudley and John Farr, ancestors most
likely of some of our townsmen who now bear these names; and there is
no doubt, from the choice made of them at this critical time, that
they possessed those qualifications for being Chief Magistrates of the
Borough which Prince Rupert described.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October the King left Shrewsbury, and quartered for the
night at Bridgnorth, where, Clarendon observes, “there was a rendezvous
of the whole army, which appeared very cheerful.” [<i>Vol. 2, p. 42.</i>]
Here the king stayed three days; and I am one of those who feel, that
our town and Castle were never so honoured by a royal visit as on this
occasion. Many of the Monarchs of England have been here; many crowned
heads have entered the portals of our Castle, and rested within its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
walls—Normans, Plantagenets, and Lancastrians—but to none of them,
in my mind, attaches the same deep interest, and to none is due
the same tribute of veneration, as to this unhappy monarch of the
House of Stuart. Not only was he by far the most accomplished Prince
that ever sat on the English throne, and endowed with considerable
intellectual powers,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
as his successful controversy with Henderson, the Presbyterian
Minister, clearly proved; but he was distinguished in all the relations
of private life by the highest moral principle: by a purity, fidelity,
and love, which are rarely seen in king’s courts, and have seldom been
equalled in retired domestic circles; and these virtues in him were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
combined with a deep-seated reverence for religion. He was not
blameless in his public conduct; far from it. There was a weakness
and want of stability in him, which justly exposed him to the charge
of inconstancy, if not of insincerity. He was subtle and evasive, and
it may be at times, under the pressure of very trying circumstances,
disingenuous in his transactions with his opponents, so that they
complained that they could not depend upon him. But he was refined in
the furnace of affliction. “Sweet” to him, as they have been to others,
were “the uses of adversity”; so that when his end drew nigh,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
there appeared in him, as his enemies allow, a calm heroic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
fortitude—saintly magnanimity—a firmness, combined with a gentleness
and forgiving love—which we do not often find surpassed even in the
early Martyrologies. No memorial then connected with our Castle, is to
me of equal interest to that of its having been occasionally, during
his declining fortunes, the residence of Charles I.</p>

<p>It was on one of these visits that he passed that eulogium, so well
known, and, in the opinion of many, so well deserved, on our Castle
Walk; namely, that it was the finest walk in his dominions. We can
easily picture him to our minds, (for there is no King with whose
lineaments we seem to be so familiar, in consequence of the many
inimitable paintings of him by Vandyke) we can easily picture him, with
measured step and pensive aspect, taking his walk along this terrace,
and his face for a moment lighted up with pleasure at the fair scene
which burst upon him; each step as he advanced bringing into view some
new and striking object—the bold front of the High Rock—the wooded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
declivities of Apley—the graceful winding of the Severn, with its
“margent green,” and the sloping uplands on either side of it. But
he could not give free indulgence to such pleasurable emotions, for
a heavy burden of care lay upon his mind, which did not admit of his
thoughts being long diverted to anything else.</p>

<p>He left Bridgnorth on the 15th of October, and eight days after was
fought the famous Battle of Edge Hill,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
in Warwickshire, where, if it had not been for the fiery impetuosity of
Prince Rupert, such a signal victory might have been gained by the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
over the forces of the rebels, as to decide the fate of the campaign
in his favour. Then followed the taking of Banbury Castle, the march
of the King’s army to Oxford and Reading, and the capture of the town
of Marlborough. These military operations in different parts of the
country convinced the authorities of Bridgnorth of the necessity of
making further preparations for the defence of the town, and we find
a Common Hall order was passed for this purpose, dated November 29th,
1642:—“Watch and ward shall be duly set day and night in all convenient
places of the towne where the Bayliffs shall think fit, and the open
places within the said towne to be made up as the Bailiffs shall find
expedient; and such as are minded for their own safety, and the safety
of the towne, to bear arms, they are desired with all convenient
expedition to provide arms at the general charge of the towne.”</p>

<p>But in the beginning of the next year they deemed it necessary to
introduce a few horse soldiers into the town, as appears from a Common
Hall order, dated January 25th, 1643; by which it was agreed that nine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
dragoons should be maintained at the general charge of the said town.
Towards the charge of the said nine dragoons, it is stated that Mr.
Thomas Corbett undertook to lend a horse and provide a rider, so that
the town should bear the charge of the horse and rider. Thomas Glover
undertook to provide two horses, saddles, and bridles, at 1s. per day
for the hire of each horse. Several other persons furnished a horse
and sword, and a bandolier each. Captains of the watch and ward were
appointed, with orders that the said watch and ward be from Six o’clock
in the morning until Six o’clock in the evening, and from Six o’clock
in the evening until Six o’clock in the morning; and it was appointed
that eight men should watch in the night, and six men in the day.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this year, the King had made Lord Capel, Lieutenant
Governour of our county, than whom there is not one in either party
during those troubled times that bore a more honoured name—a
loyal-hearted servant of the crown—a dutiful and devout member of the
Church of England—one of the firmest, as well as noblest, champions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that the royal cause could boast of.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
While exercising his function as Lieutenant Governor of Shropshire, he
was not unmindful of so important a post as Bridgnorth, but adopted
means for its security, as we find by an order of the Common Hall, of
May 23rd, 1643:—“The Right Honorable the Lord Capel, Lieutenant General
to the Prince his Highness, of his Majesty’s forces in the countyes of
Worcester, Salop, and Chester, and the six northern countyes of Wales,
hath appointed Sir Thomas Wolrich, Knight and Bart., to draw his forces
of the trayned band of this county which are under his command, to this
towne and neighbourhood hereabouts of Bridgnorth; it is agreed that
fortifications be made in all fords and places about this towne, and
the liberties thereof, where the said Thomas Wolrich shall think good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to appoint, and that all the men of this towne shall come themselves,
or send labourers to this work, with all speed; unto which work Edward
Cressett, Esq., and Edward Acton, Esq., justices of peace of the said
county, being present, do promise to send labourers and workmen out of
the country. Secondly, whosoever has volunteered will bear arms for
the defence of this towne, and the neighbourhood hereabouts, shall
be listed, and attend the service of training weekly, upon every
Tuesday, to be exercised therein, whose teaching and training for that
service Lieutenant Billingsley (at the towne’s entreaty) is pleased to
undertake.”</p>

<p>The year 1644 was a disastrous one to the royal cause, in consequence
of the signal victory, which Cromwell gained over Prince Rupert at
Marston Moor, July 2nd; and the following year opened very gloomily on
the fortunes of the king; but the people of Bridgnorth did not desert
the cause of their sovereign, though recent events had proved it to be
a failing one, but they made further preparations for resisting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
insurgents, and for holding out against them.</p>

<p>It appears that a Committee had been formed for the purpose of
hastening forward the works, and for putting the town in as good a
posture of defence as the circumstances would allow. The following is a
copy of another order made by them, dated May 21st, 1645:—</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">“Commissioners present,</li>
<li class="isub3">Sir Lewis Kirke, Governor.</li>
<li class="isub3">Sir Edward Acton, Bart.</li>
<li class="isub3">Edward Cressett, Esq.</li>
<li class="isub3">Francis Billingsley, Lieutenant Colonel.</li>
<li class="isub3">Thomas Wynde, Lieutenant Colonel.</li>
<li class="isub3">John Bromley, Esq.</li>
<li class="isub3">Arthur Weaver.</li>
<li class="isub3">Edward Latham.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is ordered that with all convenient speed Colonel Billingsley shall
place soldiers and arms in the North Gate, in Whitburn and in the
Hungry Gates, and that the barns without the works be pulled down,
and that the prisoners who are there be taken thence and disposed of
elsewhere, by Mr. Bailiffs, and that the Towne Walls on both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
North Gate, and the works about the towne, be presently made up, and
the Towne Hall and New House pulled down, and for the making of the
said wall the treasurer to lay out money not exceeding £10 for workmen,
to be repaid out of the first money raised out of the delinquents’
Estates. <i>Copia vera.</i>”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
On the 10th of June there was a farther order on the subject. “At a
Comon Hall it was agreed that the Chamberlain of the towne should cause
the Towne Hall to be taken down with all convenient speed according
to the foregoing order from Sir Lewis Kirke, governor of the said
towne, and other above-named Commissioners, and that the Chamberlain
shall make sale thereof for the most benefit of the towne, and what
they cannot sell thereof, to cause the timber which shall remain to be
carried into the church, there to remain until further use shall be
for the same for the towne. And the New House is in the like manner to
be taken down if needs require. And it is further also agreed that the
Towne’s Bonds and writings concerning the towne, which are in the New
House, shall be left with the Towne Clerk, or in any other place which
the Bailiffs and he shall think fit. And if they shall happen to be
taken from them the towne is to bear the loss of them, and not they,
because they are not able to warrant them, nor anything else that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
have of their own, as it is very well known both to the towne and
country, whereof they are all very sensible, this towne being every day
in danger of being taken.” The Town Hall, which, as it appears by a
deed, dated Oct. 20th, 1645, stood upon the site of the old Poor House,
of St. Leonard’s Parish, outside the North Gate, was accordingly pulled
down forthwith, and in the month following, July, 1645, the New House
was also pulled down. [<i>Apley Papers.</i>]</p>

<p>Four days after the date of this order, was fought another great
battle, at Naseby in Northamptonshire—fatal to the fortunes of the
King; for here again, through the impetuous and fiery temper of Prince
Rupert, who could brook no delay when an enemy was in sight, and listen
to no counsel that was not prompted by a spirit as daring as his own,
the King’s troops were hurried on prematurely to the attack, and though
they displayed a courage worthy of the Cavalier who led them, they
were eventually routed, and suffered a signal defeat. All the cannon,
ammunition, and baggage, were taken, and the whole of the infantry made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
prisoners. The King in person had the command of the main body, and,
as Whitelock observes, “displayed in this action all the conduct of a
prudent general, and all the valour of a stout soldier;” [<i>Hume, Vol.</i>
<span class="smcap">vii</span>, <i>p. 54</i>.] but he was forced at last
by the solicitations of his friends to retire, leaving the insurgents
masters of the field. He retreated to Lichfield, thence to Bewdley,
thence to Raglan and Chepstow Castles, and afterwards to Wales,
uncertain as to the best place for collecting the remnant of his army,
and for providing for his own personal safety.</p>

<p>But an incident took place at Bridgnorth, about a month after the
Battle of Naseby, which might have changed the whole aspect of the
affairs of the kingdom, and restored Charles to the throne; but
Providence designed it otherwise. Cromwell was near meeting his death
beneath the walls of our town; and if the Bridgnorth soldier had been a
little better marksman, we should never have heard of the Protectorate
of Oliver Cromwell, or possibly of the Commonwealth of England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The account of this incident may be found among the <i>Blakeway Papers</i>,
in the Bodleian Library, and is as follows:—“1645. Weekly Account.
Tuesday, July 15th. Lieutenant General Cromwell riding within twice
pistole shot of the town of Bridgnorth, on Friday last, to view it,
making some stand to speak with his officers that were with him, a
brace of musquet bulletts, shot from the enemies works, hit a Cornet
of his regiment with whom the Lieutenant General was then talking, but
blessed be God the person aimed at escaped without any hurt.”</p>

<p>Amidst the disaffection which prevailed at this time in so many parts
of the kingdom, Shropshire still continued firm in its allegiance to
the King; and therefore it was thought advisable, when he was about
to take up his winter quarters at Worcester, that he should pass
through our county, as affording him the safest line of march; and
this route brought him again to Bridgnorth. It is thus noticed by
Clarendon:—“Prince Maurice waited on his Majesty, [at Denbigh] with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
800 horse. And now being thus strengthened, they less apprehend the
enemy; yet continued their march without resting, till fording the
Severn, they came to Bridgnorth, the place designed.” (<i>Vol. 2, p.
714.</i>) There are also several entries in a Diary, called “<i>Iter
Carolinum</i>,” which state that Charles was here occasionally about the
same time; but it is not easy to make out an exact correspondence
between the dates which it gives, and those referred to by Clarendon.
The Diary, which is one of much interest, bears the following
title:—“Iter Carolinum: being a succint relation of the necessitated
marches, retreats, and sufferings of his Majesty Charles the First,
from Jan. 1641, till the time of his death in 1648. Collected by a
daily attendant upon his sacred Majesty during all the said
time.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>

There are extant two letters<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
of King Charles’s, written to his Secretary Nicholas, from Bridgnorth.
They contain nothing of any great moment; but the fact of their being
written from our town, under the peculiar circumstances in which he was
then placed, invests them with a certain degree of interest. The first
is dated October 1st.: the year is not given, but it was most probably
1642,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>

October of that year.</p>

<p>Soon after the date of this letter, the King set out for Newark, from
whence, after a while, he retreated towards Oxford, where he arrived on
the 7th. of November, “having finished,” as Clarendon writes, “the most
tedious and grievous march that ever King was exercised in: having been
almost in perpetual motion from the loss of the Battle of Naseby to
this hour, with such a variety of dismal accidents, as must have broken
the spirits of any man who was not truly magnanimous.” (<i>Vol. 2, p. 713.</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>While the King was being exposed to these personal hazards and
distresses, many towns and cities in his interest, in different parts
of the country, had been obliged to submit to the parliament, and among
these Bridgnorth; which, after a vigorous resistance, and holding out
boldly for three weeks, was compelled at length to surrender.</p>

<p class="space-below2">It appears, however, that long previous to the
final siege and capture of Bridgnorth, the rebels had on one occasion
got possession of it for a short time. The following letter, which
refers to this fact, and which describes a sharp encounter between the
rebel and royalist forces, will be read with some interest; though it
is probable that the facts are somewhat distorted by the strong party
feeling of the writer.

<p class="center">1642, Oct. 5. Letter from Bridgnorth to<br />
Dudley Norton.<br />Exceeding joyful news from his Ex. Earl of E.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Sir,<br />
<span class="ws2">Having</span> received so many favors from you in this
kinde, I have thought it requisite to inform you what hath happened
here at Bridgnorth since my last letter. His E. his Qr. Master General
came hither on Sunday, the 2 of Octr.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and by virtue of a Commission from his Ex. provided billeting for 10
regiments of horse, and near 6000 foot, with us and in our neighbour
villages. Now, by the way, I must inform you that a great many having
been lately oppressed by his Majesty’s forces, seemed somewhat
unwilling to give entertainment to any more souldiers, but to be short
they must do it, or else deservedly suffer under the censure of a
malignant party, and so be in danger of having their houses plundered
by souldiers, who take upon them to execute justice without or feare or
law, or religion, esteeming all those papists, or favourers of papists
that doe not desist from countenancing such uncivil actions, but deny
to be assistant in the performance; wherefore, after the necessity was
well examined, they were resolved rather to put all into the hands of
Almighty God, then any way to seem averse, which would not only bring
ruine to the estate, but presents. [<i>sic.</i>]</p>

<p>On Thursday, at night, we expected his Ex. would have made
Bridgnorth his quarters, but before noone we heard the echoing notes
of the shrill trumpet, which caused to think his Ex. had been neare,
but having sent out scouts to descry the truth, and give us notice,
they brought us word that Duke Maurice, the Lord Strange, Marquisse
Hartford, the Lord Paulet, M. Hastings, of Leicestershire, S. John
Biron, with a very considerable army, were upon a march to our town,
which news began to startle us: instantly an alarm was given, every man
from 16 to 50, and upwards, got himself into such arms as they could
presently attaine, or could imagine be conduceable, for the defence of
the towne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise we had 5 field pieces and 3 troups of horse, which came to
guard them from Worcester, in our town, being come the night before;
those we mounted upon the church, and the rest in the best places where
we could conceive we might prejudice the enemy. Our troups of horse
made good a passage where they were to pass over before they could
attaine to the towne. Our foote made good severall other marches and
entrances, according to our utmost skill and best endeavours. The Lord
Strange feeling himself thus defeated, and having been gauled twice or
thrice with our pieces from the top of the church, made a stand and
drew up some companies of foote under the covert of a grove of willows,
who, with their muskets, played upon our troups of horse and beat them
from their passage, wounding neare 20, inasmuch that they began to wade
the foard,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
which being descried, we, with our bowes and arrowes, sent to them,
which did so gaul them, being unarmed men, (only offensive armies) that
with their utmost speed they did retreat, striving to renew the shelter
of the grove to hide them from us.</p>

<p>During this conflict, his Ex. with severall regiments of horse
drewe neare the towne; which caused the Lord Strange to draw into a
champayn field between our towne and him, endeavouring to intercept
his passage, having got intelligence that his grosse body was about
3 hours march behind. Notwithstanding the Lord Strange his armie was
very considerable both of horse and foote, yet the forces under the
command of the Earle of Essex were so eager to fall on, that maugre all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
perswasions they would not stay till that the foote marcht up to second
them; but having received directions from the Earle, they charged them
boldly with their carbine shot, deviding so their troups, that at one
onset both van and reare were charged so fiercely that, spight of all
the cavalier’s discretion, they lost their order, and in a confused
manner retreated basely.</p>

<p>In this confusion many men were lost and hurt on both sides, but
which side most, is not yet apparently knowne; and amongst them my Lord
Paulet<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
was noosed, who, as it was reported, made a wise speach at the head of
the armie before the skirmish, animating them on to bloody crueltie,
and we doubt not but that he shall in some measure taste of the same
dish he hath provided for others.</p>

<p>The next day a messenger was sent to Shrewsbury, to desire that
Captain Winget, who was taken prisoner before Worcester, might be
exchanged for one of the others; but what return wee shall have is not
yet knowne.</p>

<p>It is conceived there was about 80 killed and 45 wounded on both
sides, but which side lost most I cannot say; onely we ought to give
God thanks that during the space of five hours bickering, no more
blood should be shed. This is the truth of our proceedings. At my next
opportunity I shall send to you. Fare well.</p>

<p class="space-above2">We learn also from the following extract from
a Puritan tract, entitled “<i>The Burning Bush not consumed</i>,” that in
the Autumn of the year 1645, that is, about half-a-year before the
capture of the town and castle, a detachment from the garrison of
Shrewsbury [at that time in the hands of the rebels] made an attempt
on Bridgnorth, which partially succeeded:—“About the 12th. inst., (<i>i.
e.</i> 12th. Sept., 1645) we received certain intelligence by letters from
<i>Shrewsbury</i>, that the valiant and victorious forces of that brave and
most active garrison, having intelligence in what posture the enemy
lay at <i>Bridgenorth</i>, they suddenly and silently marched thither, and
undiscovered fell upon the sentinels, soone surprized them, carried
the town itself, and then fell upon the enemy, drove them into the
Castle, slew some of them, and tooke some prisoners that the enemy had
of theirs, tooke about 180 horse, and some good pillage; all which they
safely brought away, and returned triumphantly to <i>Shrewsbury</i> againe.”
(<i>Part</i> <span class="smcap">iv</span>, <i>p. 268</i>.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, the final siege and capture of Bridgnorth that is the
matter of chief interest to us, and fortunately we have a very detailed
account of what then took place.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The Parliamentary Committee of Shrewsbury, after the surrender of the
garrison of High Ercall, despatched a party of horse and foot against
Bridgnorth. But these being delayed longer than was anticipated, on
account of the length of the march, and the fatigue which they had
suffered in consequence, the inhabitants received notice of their
design, and had time to make some preparations against the attack.
Nevertheless the day following, <i>i. e.</i> March 31, 1646, they were
summoned to surrender. Colonel Billingsley, who commanded the town,
made no reply to the summons, and Colonel Howard, who held the Castle,
sent a peremptory answer of defiance. On this the Parliamentary forces
formed themselves into three divisions, and determined to storm the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
town. The cavalry approached the North Gate by the Broseley Road; that
part of it, lying between the present Turnpike Gate and the Innage
Lane, being then a very deep and narrow defile, in some places 80 feet
deep. At this point they suffered severely; for the King’s troops,
taking advantage of the nature of the ground, killed many of them,
not only by shot, but by rolling down large stones upon them from the
summit of the rock. A body of infantry, however, made their approach by
a path considerably to the left of this, most probably by the fields
adjoining the old Rope Walk, and from thence by Love Lane they advanced
against Saint Leonard’s Church Yard. Into this they easily forced an
entrance, as it was only slightly fenced by palisades. There a sharp
encounter ensued between them and a body of the King’s troops, and
before the fight was done many were left companions of the dead, on
whose graves they had so fiercely fought. Among these was the gallant
Colonel Billingsley, the leader of the Royalists. The sword which he
used on the occasion, is now in the possession of a descendant of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
family, in the parish of Astley Abbots, by whom it is preserved with
all the reverent care, which is due to so valuable an heirloom. It had
often been drawn by this brave cavalier in the cause of his rightful
sovereign, and it did its last service in one of the consecrated
enclosures of that church, which he, as well as other noble soldiers
of his time, felt it both his duty, and one of the privileges of his
birthright, to defend. He lies buried in the Church Yard of Astley
Abbots, his native parish; but the parish of Saint Leonard has reaped a
benefit from its Church Yard having been the scene of the last gallant
action which he performed; for it was partly at least on this account,
that a connection of Colonel Billingsley founded and endowed the
Hospital for ten poor widows, which stands on the south side of Saint
Leonard’s Church. The inscription over the gate bears witness to this.
It is as follows.—</p>

<p class="center">“Anno Domini, MDCLXXXVII.</p>

<p>These <span class="smcap">Almes Houses</span>, for ten poor Widdows of this upper Town,
were Built and Endowed by <span class="smcap">Francis Palmer</span>, late <span class="smcap">Rector</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of <span class="smcap">Sandy</span>, in the County of Bedford, who had an affection to
this Place, his Mother being buried in this Church, and was Sister to
Colonel <span class="smcap">Francis Billingsley</span>, late of Abbots Astley, slain in
this Church Yard, in the Service of <span class="smcap">King Charles</span> ye first.”</p>

<p>But it is time to return to the narrative of the siege. The infantry
of the Parliamentary forces having succeeded in the encounter with
the King’s troops in the Church Yard, immediately opened the North
Gate, and gave admittance to the cavalry; and before this combined
body of horse and foot, the Royalists were compelled to retreat into
the Castle. On their way they were annoyed by the inhabitants of the
town, who hurled stones and other missiles on them, from the stalls and
piazzas which lined the High Street. It is evident that a bad feeling
had sprung up between them, from what cause is not exactly known. I
have seen documents which clearly prove that some Roundheads had been
for a time in the town, secretly plotting against the cause of the
King; and these very likely stirred up ill will between the soldiers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the inhabitants, which, as other documents clearly prove, was
aggravated by the rude license which soldiers under such circumstances
often give themselves.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Whitelock states (<a href="#Page_206"><i>p. 206</i></a>) that the town had refused
to bring in a month’s provisions for the troops, which had been expected, and this
was a wrong which no doubt deepened the feeling of resentment already
existing. To this, some suppose is to be attributed the destruction of
the town by fire, which the King’s troops effected after getting into
the Castle. This act on their part, however, may have been, one, simply
of self defence; for they very probably thought, that if the enemy
obtained possession of the town as it stood, it would give them great
advantage in carrying on the siege of the Castle, and of this advantage
they were determined to deprive them. They therefore at once set fire
to the town. The first house that caught fire was one in Listley
Street, which stood near the northern postern of the Castle, and from
this it spread till it reached the middle of High Street; there it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
extinguished by the exertions of the Parliamentary troops. The garrison
of the Castle made a second attempt on Easter Tuesday, and completely
succeeded. Unhappily for the ancient Church of St. Leonard’s, the rebel
army had converted it into a powder magazine—for in the rude time
of war but little respect is paid to the consecrated houses of God,
provided they can be turned to any advantage; and they who scrupled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
not to make Worcester Cathedral a stable for their cavalry horses,
would not hesitate to turn the Parish Church of St. Leonard’s into an
ammunition store. But it proved fatal to the building; for the Governor
of the Castle, Sir Lewis Kirke, hearing of the circumstance, caused a
cannon to be mounted on a round tower on the North East side of the
Castle, and from thence bombarded the Church, and set fire to it. The
wind being high, the flames quickly spread to the adjoining College and
Almshouses, and at last consumed all that remained of the High Town.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
The soldiers belonging to the army of the Parliament endeavoured to
arrest the progress of the fire, but they were so galled by shots
fired from the walls of the Castle, that they were obliged to give
over the attempt; so that the flames spread in every direction without
resistance, and soon accomplished the work of destruction. Thus was
our ancient town laid in ruins: scarcely anything belonging to it
was spared. Private houses and public offices—the receipt of custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and the hall of justice—the mart of merchandise and the sanctuary of
God—alike had become a prey to the devouring element; and little or
nothing was left but bare walls, blackened and defaced by fire. The
misery of the inhabitants is described as having been most severe. Rich
and poor alike (for it was one of those visitations which levels all
distinctions) were left houseless, and sought shelter where they could,
in the fields around the town, in thickets, and under rocks: all their
household property destroyed, and their life itself in jeopardy. Many a
wretched invalid, wholly unfit to be moved, would be hurried from his
bed to escape the flames—those at least who had any to care for them;
while some, no doubt, in the confusion and alarm would be forgotten,
and left to die a more awful death than they had looked for—their own
bed becoming their funeral pile. He surely brings on himself a fearful
responsibility who heedlessly evokes the spirit of war, and without an
imperative necessity draws the sword to do its dreadful work.

<p>The Parliamentary army were not deterred from the purpose on which they
were sent, by the horrors that surrounded them (for they were dauntless
men); but laid close siege to the Castle. They directed their attack
against the Close, which was a place within the inner Castle adjoining
the Great Tower, and containing within it the Governor’s house. They
chose Pam-pudding Hill as the best platform on which to erect their
battery, and from thence they bombarded the Castle for three weeks; but
to no purpose. No breach was effected. The garrison, from the great
eminence on which they stood, quite overlooked the besieging party; and
their cannonade from the tower was so effective as to overpower that of
the enemy. A singular incident is related as having taken place while
this cannonade was going on. “The battery on Pam-pudding Hill played
very furiously on the besieged: the cannoneer, answering them very
smartly from the town, sent his ball in the clear, or bore, of one of
the great guns, burst it, and killed the engineer and many others.” It
is curious that an exactly similar circumstance is said to have occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in an early stage of the siege of Sebastopol. A Russian artilleryman,
making answer to one of ours, sent a ball directly into the mouth
of the English gun, and a splinter from the gun struck our poor
artilleryman dead.</p>

<p>The leader of the Parliamentary army, seeing how fruitless the
operations were which he had hitherto engaged in, devised another mode
of assault. He determined to sap the Castle; and for this purpose
employed a party, under Colonel Lavingstone, to make a large opening on
the South side of the hill, intending to lay a Mine immediately under
Saint Mary’s Church, where the garrison had stored their ammunition.
They commenced their excavations, and the opening which they made is
still visible. It may be seen in the face of the rock which stands to
the right of the New Road, before you ascend the hill, and it still
bears the name of “Lavingstone’s Hole.” The enemy had no occasion
to proceed far with this mine; for the Governor, Colonel Howard,
perceiving what inevitable destruction it would cause to the Castle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the garrison, if the mine were sprung, surrendered to the enemy, to
prevent an unnecessary waste of human life.</p>

<p>The terms of Capitulation have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
They were honourable to the brave men, who had with such valour, and
with such true fidelity to the king, maintained this post so long in
his name, and adhered to his cause so firmly amidst the disheartening
events which were daily taking place. The Castle on its surrender came
into the possession of the Parliamentary party, who, a few months after
the seizure, entirely demolished it, and gradually removed all its
ruins, except that one lonely fragment of it, which stands on the south
east side of the Castle Hill.</p>

<p>Such was the end of this famous fortress—a stronghold indeed, made
so by nature, as well as by engineering skill, around whose walls the
storm of war had so often and so fiercely raged—a royal castle also,
over which the banner of the Kings of England had floated for more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
five hundred years, and which now sank into rain cotemporaneously with
the overthrow of the monarchy.</p>

</div>

<p>It may perhaps be a matter of surprise that in the account which has
been given of Bridgnorth during the civil wars, and of the town and
fortress, no mention has been made of the name of “Whitmore,” although
Sir William Whitmore at this time was the owner of the Castle; but the
fact is, that he had business enough on his hands in endeavouring to
defend his own residence at Apley from the attacks of the insurgents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
so that he had no time to devote to other interests. He maintained
possession of Apley till the spring of 1644, when it was taken by a
party of Roundheads, under the command of Sir John Price,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and Sir William himself made prisoner. An attempt was made to recover it in
the month of June, of the following year, by some of the King’s forces from
Worcester, Lichfield, and other garrisons; but they were encountered by
a detachment of the opposite party from Shrewsbury, and four hundred of
them taken prisoners; and Sir William Crofts, of Hereford, was among
the slain. (<i>History of Shrewsbury, Vol. 1, p. 460, note 2.</i>)</p>

<p class="space-below1">The property of Sir William Whitmore, like that of other
Royalists, was forfeited, and became the spoil of the Parliamentary party: all his
personal goods and chattels were sequestrated, and sold for the benefit
of the State, for the sum of £583 3s. 2d. His estates were siezed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
he was afterwards allowed to compound for them by paying the sum of
£5,000.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
This was the common lot of such, as in those troubled times stood for
the defence of their King, and were loyal to the last. Their personal
property was put into the hands of Parliamentary sequestrators, and
sold as forfeit to the State; and their landed estates were bought back
by their rightful owners at a considerable sacrifice. A register was
kept, and afterwards published, of the names of those who thus suffered
in the cause of loyalty, with the sum, for which they compounded,
affixed to each. It is entitled, “A Catalogue of the Lords, Knights,
and Gentlemen, that have compounded for their Estates. <i>London,
printed 1655.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
In it are to be found the familiar Shropshire names of Whitmore,
Wolwryche, Acton, Corbett, Ottley, Billingsley, Littleton, Eyton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Newport, Weld, Pigot, &amp;c.; and certainly it detracts nothing from
the honour which belongs to these ancient families, that their names
are inscribed in this “black legend,” as it was very fitly termed. On
the blank leaf of the copy which I have seen is the following entry in
manuscript:—</p>

<p class="space-above1">But under the government of Cromwell, not only laymen who
drew the sword in defence of the crown, but clergymen who maintained and taught
the principles of loyalty, and who were too honest to abandon them when
they became unpopular, were deprived of their revenues. It is computed
that the number of ministers in the Church, who were ejected from their
livings on this account, were above 9000; and the sufferings which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
many of them underwent, in consequence, form materials for the most
deeply affecting narratives.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
I am sorry to say that the minister of Saint Leonard’s was not found
among those who were faithful to their principles. While Shiffnal, and
Wellington, and Chetton, and Sidbury, and Kemberton, and Cleobury,
and Highley, and others could boast of pastors, who willingly endured
persecution for conscience sake, <i>Gilbert Walden</i>, Minister of Saint
Leonard’s, Bridgnorth, was found unfaithful in the day of trial, and
seems to have sacrificed his principles to his interest. His name is
found in the Parish Register as minister, within a year of the date
of the siege, when the town was in the hands of the Royalists; then
it disappears from it, when it was evident that the fortunes of that
party were declining; and then appears again, when the town was in
possession of the Parliamentary party. So that it is to be feared that
he professed allegiance to the King and Church when he thought their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
cause likely to prosper, but when it declined he attached himself to
the Roundheads.</p>

<p>Indeed this is scarcely a mere matter of inference, as the reader may
judge for himself from an entry, still remaining in the books of the
Corporation. It is as follows:—Bridgnorth. Aᵒ Dⁿⁱ 1644. “At the Court
Leete held in the said Town of Bridgnorth, the VIIᵗʰ day of May. Aᵒ
Caroli Augᵗ XXº Richard Synge and Willᵐ Bradley, gent, being Bayliffs.
At this Leete it was moted by the Bayliffs and others, That forsomuch
as Mr. Gilbert Walden, the late publiq Preacher of the said Town, is
recesste and gon out of the said Town, and hath deserted his place
ever sithence aboute a moneth before Easter last. That one Mr. Thomas
Laughton, Master of Artes, a Preacher (who is recommended to the place
by Sʳ Lewis Kirke, Knight, Governoʳ of the said Towne, and whoe hath
supplyed the place since Mr. Walden’s goeing away) shold be accepted by
the Town in the said Mr. Walden’s place, to be publiq Preacher of the
said Town, wᵗʰ the profitte and allowance thereunto belonginge; unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wh. all that were here present at this Leete agree, and nominate him,
the said Mr. Laughton, publiq Preacher of the said Town, with all
such proffits and allowance as the said Mr. Walden had of the Town’s
allowance in that behalfe, Soe as he preach two Sundayes at the High
Church, and the third at the Low Church, as Mr. Walden did. And this
to be further confirmed at a Common Hall, yf it be desired.” The
Parliament were not unmindful of Gilbert Walden, but in reward for his
desertion of the Royalists, placed him again in his office as Minister
of Saint Leonard’s, and restored to him all its emoluments. But far
happier were they who stood firm in the evil day, and had the Christian
courage to brave the consequences—and with such sainted men as Hall,
and Usher, and Hammond, and Jeremy Taylor, submitted to the penalties
of sequestration, poverty, imprisonment, and exile, rather than desert
what they believed the cause of God and of His Truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>But it must not be supposed, from anything that I have said on this
subject, that I regard as evil-minded, and unprincipled men, all
the Ministers of religion, who in those difficult and trying times
sided with Cromwell and the Parliamentary party. This would not only
be a most uncharitable opinion, but one formed in direct opposition
to the plainest historical evidence. There were men of deep piety
and extensive learning, who unhappily lent their countenance to the
usurpation of Cromwell—men who afterwards suffered persecution
themselves for conscience sake, and whose Christian worth was such,
that we may safely say of them, what Dr. Johnson says of Watts—that
they were to be imitated in everything except in their nonconformity.
Nothing indeed can be said in justification of the line of conduct
which they pursued, but they were prompted to it by pure and not by
corrupt motives, and so far they are to be respected. Among the great
and good men who were allied to the Parliamentary party, I should
especially name one, on account of his connection with Bridgnorth,
namely, <i>Richard Baxter</i>. It appears that he began his ministry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in this town, in the Church of St. Leonard’s; but left it after some
time, with, I am sorry to say, a very unfavourable impression as to
the character of our townsmen of that day. It is said that on leaving
them he shook off the dust of his feet against them, and declared
that their hearts were harder than the rock on which their town was
built. But his disappointment at the want of success in his ministry
here did not estrange his mind from the inhabitants of a place, where
he had commenced his course; but he felt, after years of absence, the
strongest desires for their welfare. A very pleasing proof we have of
this, in an old edition of his work, entitled “The Saint’s Rest” (A.
D. 1654); for there we find the following dedication to the people of
Bridgnorth:—</p>

<p class="f110 space-above1">TO MY DEARLY BELOVED FRIENDS<br />THE INHABITANTS OF<br />
BRIDGNORTH,<br />BOTH MAGISTRATES AND PEOPLE,</p>

<p class="f150">RICHARD BAXTER</p>

<p class="f110 space-below1">DEVOTETH THIS PART OF THIS TREATISE,<br />
IN TESTIMONY OF HIS UNFEIGNED LOVE TO<br />THEM, WHO WERE THE FIRST TO WHOM HE<br />

DIVINE MAJESTY, WHO THERE PRIVILEGED<br />AND PROTECTED HIM.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
It has been already stated that the fire, which took place during the
siege of the Castle, entirely destroyed the High Town, and left it a
heap of ruins. A few houses indeed survived the general destruction.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
One of these, which is still standing, deserves a passing notice, as
being the birthplace of Dr. Percy, Bishop of Dromore, the well known
author of “The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
It stands at the bottom of the Cartway, adjoining Underhill Street, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
is conspicuous among the dwellings which surround it, not only from
its size, but from its picturesque appearance, being ornamented with
several pointed gables, and being constructed partly of solid beams of
oak, in some places curiously carved, and partly of masonry. It was
built in the latter end of the sixteenth century, as the following
embossed inscription in the entrance hall informs us:—</p>

<p class="f120">“<span class="smcap">Except the Lord</span> BViLD <span class="smcap">the OWSE,<br />
The Labourers thereof evail nothing.<br /> Erected by R. For</span> [Qy Foster] 1580.”</p>

<p>It was a large and stately mansion, and when the Cartway was the
principal entrance to the town it was well situated, and must have been
regarded as a dwelling of some importance. It is now in a neglected
condition, a large part of the building is untenanted, a part of the
premises is used for an iron foundry, and another part for a huckster’s
shop. But even in its present rude and decayed condition, a certain
degree of interest attaches to it, as being one of the few surviving
relics of our old town; which interest is further enhanced, from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
having been, about an hundred years ago, the birth place of one, whose
literary attainments may be supposed to reflect no little honor on Bridgnorth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_185" name="P_185">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_185.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="493" />
</div>

<p>It remains for us to consider how the town recovered from the state of
almost total ruin in which it had been left, and was made habitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
again. It appears that in the same year in which it was destroyed,
the Bailiffs and others forwarded a Petition to the House of Commons,
setting forth in strong terms the miserable condition to which the
inhabitants had been reduced, and praying for relief. They state
that the loss sustained by them amounted to £90,000, or thereabouts;
that upwards of three hundred poor families had been “inforced” by
the loss of their goods, their trade, and habitations, “to disperse
into severall parts of the country, for harbour and for subsistence,
many among them crying aloud for bread”: and they humbly beseech the
Parliament to authorize a general collection to be made for them
throughout the country, or in some other way, to afford relief to their
necessities. The Rev. Gilbert Walden, who has been referred to before,
took this petition to London, and by his zeal and diligence obtained a
favorable answer to it; as appears from the following extract in the
Common Hall Order Book:—“Bridgnorth. At a Comon hall of the said Town
of Bridgnorth, the 27th. of January, Aᵒ Dⁿⁱ 1647. Francis Burne and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Richard Synge, Gent., being Bailiffs, &amp;c.&nbsp; *  *  *  * &nbsp;At this Comon hall,
Mr. Gilbert Walden, Minister of this Town, and Publiq Preacher,
returning to the Town from London, 25th. of this January Instant,
came into this comon hall in his own pson, &amp; acquainted the Town
with his great care &amp; paynes in solliciting the Parliament with a
peticion from the Town, for some repaire of their great loss by the
late burning of the High Town of Bridgnorth, when the Church, Colledg,
and Almshouses were burnt with the said Town. All the losses thereby
sustynedd amounting to 90,000£, as by the said Peticion was set forth
and certified: and the said Mr. Walden pducing lres pattents, under
the great seale of England, for a general collecion thorough out all
England, for rebuilding of the said Town, and repayringe the said
losses, and moving for some course to be taken for distributing the
Briefs, and setting them on work in all shires of England and Wales,
with all ye convenient expidicion that might be, and advising a way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
that behalf; and shewing the Town withall that it had cost him in the
acquiring &amp; getting of these Lres pattentes and Briefs, besides the
great troubling of his friends to ayde &amp; assist him therein.”</p>

<p>But these letters patent, under the Great Seal, granted by the
Parliament, seem to have yielded but little fruit to the impoverished
inhabitants of Bridgnorth; and the collections made under its sanction
were so inadequate to their wants, that they were obliged to resort to
other means for obtaining relief. They addressed a circular letter,
(to some merchants in London, as I conclude from the contents of it)
complaining bitterly of the very little sympathy which had been shewn
to them throughout the country, and of the very scant measure of
assistance which they had received, and very earnestly soliciting their
aid. It also appears that another circular was drawn up, to be sent for
the same purpose to persons whom they supposed to be well affected to
Bridgnorth, in the counties of Derby, Worcester, and Gloucester. The
first is as follows:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“Gentlemen,<br />
<span class="ws2">In</span> the behalfe of our poore Towne, whereof
wee are now the representative Body, wee heartiely thanke you for that
you have ben pleased to put your helping hands to raise us up againe
out of the Ashes. Our greatest hopes is in the charity of yourselves
and your friends in the citie. Wee have had sad experience of the
countries chariety, yet what the further result wil be wee daylie must
expect; howsoever, wee shall acknowledge our engagements unto you above
all other, be it less or more. Wee beseach you continew your care and

&amp; friends to cerve you.</p>

<p>Bridgnorth, 10 may,<br />
<span class="ws3">1647.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>The state of destitution, in which the inhabitants of this ruined town
were placed, was such, that it is no wonder that they looked in every
direction for relief, from whence they thought it at all likely to
come, and that they were thus urgent in their appeal for it. In one
case they were not disappointed, as appears from the following letter,
addressed, about the same date I suppose, to Mr. Pully, of Essex: a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
name well known, and gratefully remembered by the people of Bridgnorth,
for other benefits besides those referred to here.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot space-above1 space-below1">
<p class="no-indent">“To Mr. Pully, of Essex.<br />
<span class="ws2">Wee</span> have cause to blesse God that our miserable
towne affords a native friend so far to besteed us as by yourself. Wee

<p>Wee entreat you to go on in helping us, as Mr. Bushopp hath told us

<p>Who speake in the behalf of ourselves, our minister, and whole towne.”</p>
</div>

<p>The want of a Town Hall seems to have been much felt by the Burgesses
of Bridgnorth—the former one, which stood outside the North Gate,
having been pulled down during the Civil Wars; but the erection of a
new one, with new materials, was more than they could possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
accomplish, in the impoverished state in which they had been left. They
therefore applied to Lady Bartue of Wenlock, and petitioned that she
would grant them the materials of an old barn which were about to be
sold, for the sum of £40 or £50; by means of which they might be able
to rebuild the Hall.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The petition was granted; but whether the old materials were bestowed
as a free gift, or sold for the sum specified, does not appear. The
building was in consequence erected; and partly, at least, through the
earnest advice of Mr. Gilbert Walden, in a letter addressed by him to
the Bailiffs, was placed, not in the situation of the former Hall, but
in the middle of the High Street. It was not completed, however, till
four years after the date of his letter (April 24th., 1648); as appears
from the following entry in the Common Hall Order Book:—</p>

<p>“The New Hall set up in the Market Place of the High Street of
Bridgnorth was begun, and the stone arches thereof made, when Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Francis Preen and Mr. Symon Beauchamp were Bayliffs in summer, 1650.
And the Timber work, and building upon the same stone arches, was set
up when Mr. Thomas Burne and Mr. Roger Taylor were Bayliffs of the said
Town of Bridgnorth, in July and August, 1652.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="P_192" name="P_192">&nbsp;</a>
    <img src="images/p_192.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="448" />
    <p class="center space-below1"><big><b><i>The Town Hall.</i></b></big></p>
</div>

<p>But notwithstanding these applications for assistance from various
quarters, and the earnest efforts made by the inhabitants themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the town appears to have continued during the period of the
Commonwealth, almost in the same state of ruin in which it was left
after the siege—the Church, College, and Almshouses,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
still roofless and dilapidated—and nothing effectual was done for
their restoration, and the rebuilding of the town, till the reign of
Charles II. Shortly after he was restored to the throne, a very earnest
Petition was forwarded to him from the Bailiffs and Burgesses of the
Borough, and other inhabitants of the town, praying for relief; and
this Petition was accompanied by a certificate, under the hands and
seals of Sir William Whitmore, Sir Thomas Wolrich, Sir Walter Acton,
Sir John Weld, Sir Richard Ottley, and others, attesting the damage
which had been done to the town, and the amount of the loss of property
sustained by the inhabitants in consequence. This petition, backed by
this certificate, drew from the King a proclamation,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
addressed to all his subjects in behalf of Bridgnorth. It is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
long and elaborate—very carefully worded—and not only sets forth
very fully the wants of the petitioners, but pleads their cause with
a warmth and earnestness which one would not expect to find in an
official document. It authorizes a general collection to be made
throughout the kingdom; “in all and every the Cities, Towns Corporate,
Priviledged Places, Parishes, Hamlets, Villages, and all other places
whatsoever,” in order to assist the destitute people of Bridgnorth
in rebuilding their shattered town; and it directs both Ministers
and Churchwardens to do what in them lies to further this object in
their different localities. It would be interesting to know the exact
amount which this royal proclamation, and another which followed it
in about ten years, produced. There is no doubt that it was something
considerable—sufficient to give an impulse to the industry of the
inhabitants—to enable them to restore their ruined Church, College, and
Almshouses—to efface in a great measure the damages of war, and to make
Bridgnorth again a habitable town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, from the happy restoration of the monarchy in England, and the
re-establishment of its church, we may date the restoration of our town
from the state of ruin, in which it had been left; and its restoration
being coeval with these important and felicitous events, many would
be disposed to regard as no bad omen of its welfare. The motto in the
arms of a neighbouring city may well express our wish for its future
prosperity; for though the terms are hardly suitable to a town of so
small a circumference as ours, yet it merits well the character it has
maintained, in almost every era of its history—<i>Floreat semper fidelis
civitas</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My subject was “The Antiquities of Bridgnorth.” I have already far
passed the boundaries which confined me to such a subject, by referring
to matters which occurred so late as the reign of Charles II. I would,
however, venture one step farther, and refer to an event which took
place in the reign of his successor, James II, for I find that it was
taken particular notice of in Bridgnorth at the time of its occurrence;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and it is one which, from the great interest and importance that
attaches to it, seems to claim attention from us whenever it happens to
be brought before us.</p>

<p>The event referred to occurred in the memorable year of 1688. In the
“Blakeway Papers,” in the Bodleian Library, which contain matters
concerning Bridgnorth, the following entry is made respecting
it:—“When the Bishops were quit, there were 16 bonefires in this town,
and the ringing of bells night and day. Mr. Cornes and Mr. Bailey,
the two Ministers, refused to sign the Declaration.” This notice
alludes to the well known Declaration issued by King James, and the
acquittal of the seven Bishops who had been imprisoned for venturing
to oppose it. James the Second was as zealous a member of the Church
of Rome, perhaps, as any of his subjects, lay or ecclesiastical; and
the great object of his life seemed to be, to regain for his Church the
same usurped authority over the civil and religious liberties of our
country, which she possessed before the Reformation. Among other means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
for furthering this object, he published this famous “Declaration.” It
was a very singular document. On the plea of establishing liberty of
conscience, it abrogated, on the King’s sole authority, all the penal
laws which were in force on the subject of religion, the King thus
assuming to himself, as one of his royal prerogatives, the power of
dispensing with exiting statutes, without the consent of Parliament.
The real intention of the King in all this was, to open the door to
Roman Catholics to places of power and authority, which the laws then
in force strictly forbade, as being incompatible with the freedom and
safety of the state. To give publicity, as well as sanction, to this
Declaration, the King issued a command that it should be read by the
Clergy during Divine Service, in every church in the kingdom. The whole
proceeding was perfectly arbitrary and despotic; and if it had been
allowed to go on unchecked, it would, as it has been well observed,
have given a death blow to the Constitution, and have laid the nation’s
liberties at the feet of the sovereign. Where then were the champions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
freedom in this great crisis of danger? Where were to be found the
men, who had courage enough to resist this portentous encroachment on
the liberties of England? Where the assertors of the nation’s rights
against these unlawful inroads of the royal prerogative? Not in a
band of youthful and ardent enthusiasts in the cause of freedom—not
in a knot of ruthless republicans, whose tempers were impatient of
monarchial rule, and who hated the very name of King—not in a set
of restless innovators, who loved innovation for the excitement it
produced, or for the spoil which it might yield to them—not in a rude
soldiery, who were ambitious of enterprise, and longed to signalize
themselves again by deeds of daring—but in the persons of seven aged
Bishops of the Church, some of whom were not only oppressed by the
burden of age, but weighed down by sickness and infirmity; and all of
them, both from temper and principle, averse to anything that seemed
like resistance to kingly authority. Yet it was these who stood forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
at this time of danger, as the defenders of the nation’s liberties.
Their names were well known to our townsmen at the time, for
Bridgnorth, as well as other places, rang with unusual joy at the news
of their acquittal; and it is well that their names should be known
to our townspeople now, as the names of men who have laid the nation
under a deep debt of gratitude. They were Sancroft, Archbishop of

of Bristol; and Ken, the pious Bishop of Bath and Wells,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
a saint indeed, formed on the primitive model, whose devout aspirations in
his Morning and Evening Hymn have served to kindle the devotion of the
members of the English Church for nearly two centuries. These seven
Prelates met together at Lambeth in this critical juncture, and drew up
a petition to James, in which they set forth in plain but respectful
language the illegality of his Declaration, and humbly prayed him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
not to insist on their publishing it. In consequence of this they
were committed to the Tower. The King, notwithstanding their dutiful
remonstrance, was resolved on enforcing on the clergy throughout
the kingdom the publication of this unlawful document, and sent his
commands to that effect: but of the many thousands to whom this mandate
was sent, not two hundred complied with it; and among those who had the
courage to refuse, we are glad to find the names of the two Ministers
of Bridgnorth, Mr. Cornes, and Mr. Bailey.</p>

<p>The Bishops after a short term of imprisonment were admitted to bail,
and at the ensuing Sessions were impeached at Westminster Hall on a
charge of publishing a seditious libel. Every circumstance which took
place on this memorable occasion is full of interest, and historians
have thought the most minute details not unworthy of record. On their
way to the scene of trial, the Bishops, it is mentioned, received every
possible expression of reverence and sympathy from the populace, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
formed a lane for their passage, through which as they moved, many
kissed their hands and their garments, and many fell on their knees and
earnestly asked their blessing. Westminster Hall never witnessed such a
scene as their trial presented. As it proceeded, the interest felt by
the spectators was intense; and when at length the verdict was given
by the foreman of the Jury, “Not Guilty,” the profound silence which
had reigned throughout the court was broken by the most tumultuous
acclamations. The multitudes assembled there raised, in spite of the
menace of the Solicitor General, such a shout as shook the old fabric
of Westminster Hall, and conveyed, quicker than the speediest messenger
could do, the tidings to the city. The Bishops on leaving the court
immediately repaired to Whitehall Chapel, to return thanks to God for
their deliverance, and other churches were thronged by multitudes who
assembled in them for the same purpose. “The bells rung from every
tower, every house was illuminated, and bonfires were kindled in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
street.” The joy was not confined to London, it was propagated
throughout the kingdom, and felt in the remotest villages. Bridgnorth,
as we have seen, fully shared in it. Our streets on the occasion echoed
with loud shouts of triumph—the river Severn reflected on its stream
the blaze of many a bonfire—and the tuneful bells of St. Leonard’s and
St. Mary’s rang incessantly night and day to celebrate the event.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have thus brought before the reader the few historical notices which
I have been able to collect, respecting Bridgnorth, from the time of
Alfred the Great to the close of the reign of James II. I am aware how
much more interest would attach to these if they had been skilfully
handled, inasmuch as they touch on some very important events, and
memorable epochs of our national history. Those indeed who feel the
force of local attachment may read them with interest, whatever defects
may be apparent in the mode of bringing them together, and it is for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
such readers that they have been collected. I am aware also, that I
have dwelt much longer on certain facts in our history than many would
think at all necessary, or than was exactly pertinent to my subject.
My reason is, that some would read these things here, who would not be
likely to read them elsewhere; and I thought it advisable, on account
of their importance, that they should be known in detail. Besides, I
was anxious to make this little work more useful in its character, than
it would have been if I had confined myself to a statement of the facts
relating to our town, without connecting them with the general history
of England. As it is, the review which we have taken, ought not to be
without its moral influence. Many generations of men have thus passed
rapidly before us: having acted their parts in quick succession, they
have disappeared from the stage of life. They had “their exits and
their entrances,” and now are seen no more. It is natural for us to
reflect, how utterly unimportant to them it now is in what capacity
they appeared—whether as kings or subjects—whether as masters or as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
slaves—whether they were honoured or dishonoured—illustrious or
obscure—prosperous or unfortunate. It matters not to them now,
whether their projects succeeded or failed—whether the enterprises
they so keenly entered on issued in triumph or disaster. Their
restless activities have been put a stop to. The hand of death has
arrested them. The same destiny awaits ourselves. We too shall soon
make our exit; and the interests which now so deeply engage us—the
circumstances which now press on us in all their vivid reality—the
scenes which are now before our eyes, and the busy part we take in
them—will ere long be reckoned among the things that have been; and
nothing will be left us, but the character which we have acquired in
passing through them—our fitness or unfitness for a better state: and
this reflection I desire to leave on the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, scarcely natural for me to close these pages,
without expressing a wish for the future welfare of a place, the
scattered notices of whose past history I have here collected. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
been too long, and too intimately connected with it, not to feel the
wish. In Bridgnorth I have passed more than twenty years. I reckon them
the happiest of my life. I have good reason for doing so. Many domestic
blessings—many social pleasures—many natural enjoyments—have here
been allotted to me. Here “the lines have fallen to me in pleasant
places,” and in the fair scenes of nature which surround us, there has
been open to me a source of “unreproved pleasures,” of which it is
my own fault if I have not largely partaken. Here too I have formed
acquaintances, which have ripened into friendships—friendships which
have yielded me something more than mere enjoyment—and which I have
reason to hope will last as long as life itself. But still closer
ties bind me to this place. Here I have been entrusted with the care
of souls, and have been called to minister in the Church of God. This
consideration necessarily outweighs every other, and prompts me with
the most earnest wishes for the welfare of a place, between many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
inhabitants of which and myself there is so strict and sacred a
fellowship. And not from these alone, but from those also with whom I
am not thus officially connected—from the inhabitants of St. Mary’s
parish, as well as from those of St. Leonard’s, I have received such
proofs of kindness and regard during my ministry here, as make me feel
an interest in everything that can concern their well-being. May they
prosper in every way—as a community, and as individuals—in their
civil and commercial interests—in their social, moral, and religious
condition. May they secure to themselves that which has “the promise of
the life that now is, and of that which is to come:” that when things
temporal shall give place to things eternal—when the changes and
chances of this mortal life shall cease—and all the vicissitudes which
so painfully diversify the history of this world have passed away—they
may have their lot and part in that kingdom which cannot be moved, and
“of whose government and peace there shall be no end.”</p>

</div>

<p>There are so many references to the Forest of Morf in the early history
of Bridgnorth, that it may be well, for the information of the reader,
to append the following interesting description of it, given by Mr.
Eyton, in the 3rd. Vol. of his <i>Antiquities</i>, p. 212.</p>

<p>“Where now the Counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, and
Worcestershire converge, there was once a vast region of Forest, not
confined to one bank of a succession of lakes and marshes which we
now know as the Valley of the Severn, but stretching away for miles
eastward and westward. The Severn itself was in one place a land-locked
and sluggish stream; in another a series of rivulets struggling
on, with no concentrated force, amid the various impediments which
uncontrolled nature had crowded on its course. Its fits of wintry and
swollen fury, like human passions, re-acted upon themselves; for the
giant oak, which to-day was torn from its bank and plunged in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
torrent, lay on the morrow athwart the subsiding stream, an additional
element of its future bondage.</p>

<p>“The region, whose chief features I thus imagine, seems to have been
known to the Britons as <i>Coed</i>, or forest—the forest, that is, <i>par
excellence</i> of this part of England.</p>

<p>“When we read of the Forests of Morf, Kinver, and Wyre, we get notions
of extent which must be added one to the other before we can realize
any idea of the more ancient <i>Coed</i>; for the <i>Coed</i> was the parent of
the other three, and they perhaps not its only constituents.</p>

<p>“I am now to speak of Morf Forest more particularly, and, though I
cannot indicate the precise time at which it was separated from its
associates, we shall not err in ascribing the change to an increasing
population, and the Saxon devotion to agriculture.</p>

<p>“In the earliest stage of its self-existence, Morf Forest can be
ascertained to have been at least eight miles in length, while its
greatest width was more problematically about six. Its known, because
afterwards maintained, northern boundary rested upon the Worf, for
some miles before that stream falls into the Severn. Its south-eastern
extremity is determined by its name, taken from the Staffordshire
Village of Morf, where commenced that interval which gradual change had
interposed between the Forests of Morf and Kinver.</p>

<p>“By still further compression of its southern boundaries, and by large
clearances within its area, Morf Forest had, at the Norman Conquest,
been altered both in extent and character. But the Forest ground,
though alternated with cornfields and villages, was still very great,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and very great it remained for more than two centuries afterwards.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The final perambulation of this Forest was made in the reign of Edward
I, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, 1300; and it will be a matter of interest
to those who know the locality, to trace its ancient boundaries, as given in
the document, which was published after the survey was made. It is
furnished by Mr. Eyton in p. 219, and is as follows:—</p>

<p>“From Pendlestones Mulne (Pendleston Mill), going up by the Severn to
where Worgh (Worf) falls into Severn<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>:
and so going up along the bank of Worgh to Worth-brugg (Worf-bridge),
and going up thence along the said bank to Rindeleford-brugg
(Rindleford-bridge): and so going up along the bank to Chirle,
and upwards still to Chirlefordes-brugg; and so along the highway
to the <i>vill</i> of Hulton (Hilton), and thence by a certain road to
Woghbrokesheth, and so straight along the Stoni-strete<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to Apewardes Castle,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
and so along the boundary between the Counties of Salop and Stafford to
the Chirlesok: and thence direct between the King’s <i>demesne</i> in his
Manor of Claverley, and the fields of Whittimere, Borhton (Broughton),
Bebrugg (Beobridge), and Gatacre, to the Cover of Morf. And so through
the said Cover to the Blackewalle at the Oldefield, and thence to the
Shirevelydyat: and thence by the Crosweyslone (Crossways-lane) to the
hedge of the Brodenewelonde: and thence straight to Fililode, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
between the hedge and the Lythe to Trugge-put. And so going down by a
certain water-course to the Stonibrugge of Wodeton (Stone-bridge of
Wooton), and so along a water-course to Wynelesford; and thence by
the highway to Mose-lydyat, and thence to Halyweyes-lydyat; and so
by a certain path to the Hethenedich, going down by the Hethenedich
to the weir (gurgitem) of Quatford: and so going up by the Severn to
a certain ancient ditch, between the field of Brugge and the <i>vill</i>
of Quatford: and along the highway to the House of the Lepers of St.
James of Brugge: and thence right to a certain ancient ditch under
the Gyhet (Gibbet-Hill); and so straight to Baconescroft, going down
to Tissengecros; and so by the highway going up to Pendestanes Mulne,
where the first boundary of the said <i>bosc</i> begins. The Perambulators
also declare that John de Hastinges holds Rughtone (Roughton),
Barndelegh (Bradney), Hocoumbe, Swanecot, Burcote, and Bromlegh; John
de Astlegh holds the Manor of Northlegh (Nordley); John Fitz Philip
holds the <i>vill</i> of Mose; and the Dean of Brugge holds the <i>vill</i> of
Quatford,—all within the bounds of the said Forest.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <h3 class="nobreak"><span class="bigfont">B</span>.<br />(<i>Page 22.</i>)<br />BRIDGNORTH CASTLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>The sole remaining fragment of this Castle was very carefully examined
and measured by King, the author of “<i>Munimenta Antiqua</i>”; in which
work he gives the following description of it. (pp. 346-7) He was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
opinion indeed that it was a Saxon fortress; but in this he must have
been mistaken, as the testimony of history is very clear as to the
fact, that it was erected by the Norman Earl, Robert de Belesme.</p>

<p>“The exceeding solidity of whose structure [the leaning Tower] has
defied the decay of ages, the blast of gunpowder, and the continually
active force of gravity, notwithstanding it is apparently in a
tottering state.... It evidently contained three apartments, one above
another, each of which were of small dimensions, being only 23 feet 10
inches in length, and 21 feet 2 inches in breadth, and the entrance was
manifestly by an arched doorway up a flight of steps on the outside,
The marks of the places for the timbers supporting every floor are
still visible.... The walls are between 8 and 9 feet thick, or rather
more, but not quite uniformly so on each side; for the external measure
of the Tower is nearly about 41½ feet square. The outside wall next the
town has not even a loophole in it. This side however is very oddly
covered with iron hooks, which are said by tradition to have been
placed there so late as in the time of Charles I., during the civil
wars, to hang wool packs upon, in order to protect the walls from the
effects of the cannon: but as this tale is not credible, and the hooks
themselves have the appearance of being much more ancient, they serve
rather to remind one of a savage custom which sometimes prevailed in
early ages, of fastening the bodies of enemies slain on the outside of
the walls of fortresses.”

</div>

<p>A further grant was made for the same purpose by Henry III. “On May 10,
1220, King Henry III., being at Worcester, orders the Sheriff of Salop
to aid the Burgesses of Bruges in the enclosure of their town, allowing
them out of the Royal Forest near Bruges, as much of old stumps and
dead timber as would suffice to make two stacks (rogos). This was to be
done with as little injury as possible to the Forest.” (<i>Antiquities of
Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 299.</i>) Notwithstanding this caution, however, a
good deal of damage was done, on account of the large amount of timber
which was required for this purpose; for in the Sheriff’s report of the
state of the Forest in 1235 there is the following notice:—“Item. The
<i>Bosc</i> of Worfield was viewed—much wasted by ancient waste, to wit,
in the time of the great war [the Barons’ war], and also in the time
of R., late Earl of Chester, who, whilst he was sheriff, sold 1700 oak
trees there, besides other wastes made in his time for the Castle of
Bruges, and besides delivery of timber made for enclosing the <i>Vill</i> of
Bruges, before it was fortified with a wall.” (<i>Ibid, Vol. 3, p. 215.</i>)</p>

  <h3 class="nobreak"><span class="bigfont">D</span>.<br />(<i>Page 44.</i>)<br />THE CHARTER OF THE BOROUGH.</h3>
</div>

<p>The earliest written Charter was granted to the Borough in the reign of
Henry II., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, 1157, and is as follows:—</p>

<p>“Henry, King of England, and Duke of Normandy, and Aquitaine, and Earl
of Anjou, to his Justiciars, and Sheriffs, and Barons, and Ministers,
and all his faithful of England, greeting. Know ye that I have conceded
to my Burgesses of Bruge all their franchises, and customs, and rights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
which they, or their ancestors, had in the time of King Henry, my
grandfather. Wherefore I will and strictly command that they have them
well, and in peace, and honourably, and fully; within the Borough and
without, in wood and in field, in meadows and pastures, and in all
things, with such comparative fulness and honour, as they held them
in the time of King Henry, my grandfather. And I forbid any one to
do them injury or insult in regard of their tenements. Witnesses—T.
Chancellor, and Henry de Essex Constable, and William Fitz Alan, at
Raddemore.”</p>

<p>In the reign of King John a second Charter was granted, January 10,
1215. A few years afterwards this was renewed by King Henry III., who,
in a short time, considerably enlarged the privileges of the Burgesses,
in the new Charter referred to. It has been generally supposed, that
this charter was destroyed along with other documents, in the fire
which took place in Bridgnorth during the siege of the Castle. Most of
the papers, belonging to the Corporation, were placed in St. Leonard’s
Church for safety; but, this having been set fire to, they were all
burnt, and this charter, as it was supposed, among them. But I conclude
from the following passage in the Blakeway Papers that this is a
mistake, and that this original charter, granted by King Henry, may
still be in existence. In M.S. Congreve are the following historical
particulars of the town, in the reign of James II.:—The following
Aldermen subscribed to the running away with the Charter.</p>

<p>“John Lewis and William Hammonds, Bailiffs; Humphrey Braine, George
Longnor, William Baker, Thomas Weal, and about forty others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bickerton’s son subscribed for him while he was out of town.</p>

<p>“Silvanus read a recantation afterwards. Bailiff Hammonds took away the
Charter which the town had possessed for 450 years (the people of the
town pursuing him) contrary to the mind of the old sages of the town.’”</p>

  <h3 class="nobreak"><span class="bigfont">E</span>.<br />(<i>Page 123.</i>)<br />SUPPRESSION OF THE RELIGIOUS HOUSES.</h3>
</div>

<p>Whatever may have been Queen Mary’s private feelings, it is plain that
she yielded to the pressure of political expediency in this matter.
In order to induce the Parliament to repeal all the statutes made
against the See of Rome in the two last reigns, she ratified in the
fullest manner the alienation of the property which had belonged to
Abbeys, Priories, Chantries, Colleges, &amp;c., and strictly forbade any
suits against any one on that score, either by authority from the Pope,
or general council, or on pretence of any canon or ecclesiastical
constitution whatever. (<i>Collier’s Ecclesiastical History, Vol.</i>
<span class="smcap">vi</span>, <i>Book</i> <span class="smcap">v</span>, <i>pp. 94-6.</i>)</p>
<p>But there are some facts connected with the subject of the suppression
of the Monasteries, and the confiscation of their property, which
ought to be better known, in order to shew how little warrant Roman
Catholics have for representing the matter, as they commonly do, as
a piece of Protestant sacrilege. There is a valuable chapter in Mr.
Froude’s recent History of England on this subject, and much important
additional matter is brought forward in a review of his work, in the
<i>Christian Remembrancer</i> of July last. From these two sources I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
drawn the following facts, which are well worthy of attention. The
state of the Monasteries and Religious Houses generally was such,
in the reign of Henry IV., as to call from the House of Commons an
indignant remonstrance, and a petition for their secularization; and
in the reign of his successor, Henry V., when Popery was wholly in the
ascendant in this country, one hundred Monasteries were suppressed
by order of the King. (<i>Froude, Vol. 2, p. 411.</i>) But a still more
remarkable fact is the following: that a twelve month after the Act of
1536 for the suppression of smaller Monasteries in England, Pope Paul
III. appointed a committee of nine of the most eminent ecclesiastics,
to examine into the state of the Church. These persons recommended
changes far more extensive than any which the English Parliament had
contemplated. So hopeless did they consider the reformation of the
monastic bodies, that they united in recommending the total suppression
of every Monastery in Europe. One of these nine ecclesiastics was
Reginald, afterwards Cardinal Pole; and he, firmly as he was attached
to the Church of Rome, not only advised this universal sequestration
of all Convents, but did not refuse to share in the spoils of their
suppression in this country. On his arrival in England, he received
from Queen Mary a grant of lands belonging to the dissolved Priory of
Newburgh. (<i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, <i>Vol.</i> <span class="smcap">xxxii</span>, <i>p. 92</i>)
Bishop Fisher also, one of the most zealous Prelates of the Romish
party in the Church, previous to the passing of the famous Act for the
suppression of Monasteries, seized on the Nunnery of Higham, after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
vain attempt at its reformation, and by his own act set the example for
subsequent confiscations. “In fact, while the reforming<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
party in the Church were pleading for the preservation of some of
the Convents, the opposite party were contending for their utter
overthrow.” (<i>Ibid.</i>) Yet notwithstanding these facts, which are
attested by existing documents, Roman Catholics still speak as if
the suppression of these establishments was exclusively the work of
Protestants, to be ascribed to a spirit of impiety and sacrilege which
the Reformation has let loose upon the Church. The truth is, that the
Monastic and Conventual Establishments had become so totally corrupt,
and the moral disorders by which they were affected had been proved
to be so incurable, that society could no longer endure them; and the
opinion prevalent among Roman Catholics, as well as Protestants, was,
that the evil had arrived at such a height, that no remedy could be
effectual, short of the general suppression of the Religious Houses.
Both writers to whom I have referred are warm in their admiration of
the original members of the monastic bodies, and of the purposes which
such establishments answered at an earlier period of their history.
Mr. Froude says, “Originally, and for many hundred years after their
foundation, the regular clergy were the finest body of men of which
mankind in their chequered history can boast.” (<i>Vol. 2, p. 403</i>)
And his Reviewer thus speaks of the Monasteries and Convents: “Great
have been the advantages which not only devotion, but political
civilization, have received from monastic establishments. In times
of disturbance, they were the places of comparative peace—in days of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
ignorance, retreats of learning—in periods of profligacy, abodes of
devotion.” Yet, from the evidence which authentic records supply, the
conviction has been forced upon both Mr. Froude and his Reviewer,
that scarcely anything could be worse than the moral condition of
the inmates of such establishments in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. It is natural to regret that remedial measures were not
resorted to. Possibly, however, if we possessed all the information
which was in the hands of the Government and Legislature of the day, we
might be convinced that the only safe and wise course was that which
they pursued. But at all events, we must bear in mind that this course
was advocated by the warmest friends of the Papacy; and that, although
the cupidity of courtiers and public men may have hastened forward the
confiscation of monastic property, yet that Roman Catholics, and even
dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church, did not refuse a share of the spoil.</p>

<p>I think it right, in laying before my readers the foregoing statements
of Mr. Froude and his Reviewer, to express my great regret that I
had not become earlier acquainted with them. Had I possessed the
information which I have derived from them somewhat sooner, the

<p>A friend has kindly furnished me with the following passages, relating
to the Monastic orders, in the document which was presented to Paul
III., by Cardinal Pole and the other Divines. The document itself is
entitled, “Concilium delectorum Cardinalium, &amp; aliorum Prælatorum, de
emendanda Ecclesia, S. D. N. D. Paulo III. ipso jubente conscriptum, et
exhibitum, Anno M.D. XXXVIII.”

<p>The passages referred to are as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Alius abusus corrigendus est in ordinibus religiosorum, quod adeo
multi deformati sunt, ut magno sint scandalo sæcularibus, exemploque
plurimum noceant. Conventuales ordines abolendos esse putamus omnes,
non tamen ut alicui fiat injuria, sed prohibendo ne novos possint
admittere. Sic enim sine ullius injuria cito delerentur, &amp;
boni religiosi eis substitui possent. Nunc vero putamus optimum
fore, si omnes pueri qui non sunt professi, ab eorum monasteriis
repellerentur.”</p>

<p>“Abusus alius turbat Christianum populum in Monialibus, quæ sub
cura fratrum conventualium, ubi in plerisque monasteriis fiunt publica
sacrilegia cum maximo civium scandalo. Auferat ergo Sanct. vestra omnem
eam curam a conventualibus, eamque det aut Ordinariis aut aliis, prout
melius videbitur.”</p>

<p>An Act of Parliament was passed in 1571, to enforce the wearing of
Woollen Caps; but this failing to have the desired effect, and the
people still continuing to indulge their fancy in the choice of
covering for their heads, the Queen thought fit to exert her royal
prerogative in the matter, and issued a Proclamation for the purpose of
enforcing the statute. The Proclamation set forth “how that by little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and little the disobedience and wanton disorder of evil-disposed and
light persons, more regarding private fantasies and variety, than
public commodity or respect of duty, had increased by want of execution
of the said law.” It therefore commanded that Bailiffs, Constables,
Churchwardens, &amp;c., every Sunday and Festival Pay, make diligent view
and search in all Churches and Chapels, and all other places within
the circuit and compasses of their offices, for all singular breakers
and offenders of the said Statute, and without delay cause the names
of such offenders, together with the day and place of the offence, to
be then written, and lawfully ordered and committed. It states that
the violation of this Act of Parliament tended “to the decay, ruin,
and desolation of divers antient Cities and Boroughs, which had been
the nourishers and bringers up, in that faculty, of great numbers of
people, as London, also Exeter, Bristowe, Monmouth, Hereford, Rosse and
Bridgnorth.” (<i>Strype’s Annals, Vol. 2, Book 1</i>, C. <span class="smcap">viii</span>,

</div>

<p>It is a curious fact, that two of our great poets, writing in prose,
have exerted their genius to paint, the one the character of Cromwell,
the other the character of Charles I, in the darkest possible
colours. Cowley, in his “Vision,” has heaped on the Protector as many
reproachful epithets, and as stern expressions of reprobation, as the
most unrelenting royalist could desire; but the bolder wing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Author of “Paradise Lost,” has soared far above him in the region of
invective. In his famous answer to the Icon Basilica, Milton has put
together for the purpose of defaming the memory of his Sovereign, a
piece of writing perhaps as vituperative and scornful as is to be found
in the English language. But it is not in brochures, such as these,
that we are to look for just delineations of character; and as I should
consider it very unwarrantable to bring an accusation against King
Charles on the authority of Milton, I should feel it to be equally so
to found a charge of hypocrisy against Cromwell, on statements made
in “The Vision” of Cowley, or in any writing of the kind. Unhappily
the charge of hypocrisy against Cromwell rests on less questionable
evidence. The following letter, written by him to Robert Hammond,
Governor of the Isle of Wight, plainly convicts him of it; and affords
melancholy proof of how unscrupulously he could adopt the most sacred
phraseology when he had a point to gain, and enter on the discussion
of the most deeply spiritual subjects, when his real purpose all the
while was to win over his correspondent to his party, and to secure
his co-operation in furthering his own schemes. The letter to Hammond
is so curious an illustration of this, that I think it right to lay
the whole of it before the reader. The occasion of his writing it was
this:—King Charles had been induced by Cromwell’s machinations to make
his escape from Hampton Court, and to fly to the Isle of Wight, and
there to entrust himself to Hammond, the Governor. This man, when he
was required by the Army to surrender the person of the King to them,
felt strong scruples of conscience against doing so, and for a while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
refused. In order to remove his scruples, both Ireton and
Cromwell wrote to him. Cromwell’s letter<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
is written with consummate skill, but no one surely can avoid seeing
how deeply it is tainted with the odious sin of hypocrisy—all the more
odious for venturing so far on holy ground, and soiling with its touch
things so precious as the things of the Spirit of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot space-above1">
<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Robin</span>,</p>

<p>“No man rejoyceth more to see a line from thee than myself. I know
thou hast long been under tryal. Thou shalt be no loser by it. All must
work for the best. Thou desirest to hear of my experiences. I can tell
thee I am such a one as thou didst formerly know, having a body of sin
and death; but I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord there is no
condemnation, though much infirmity, and I wait for the redemption; and
in this poor condition I obtain mercy and sweet consolation through
the Spirit, and find abundant cause every day to exalt the Lord,—abase
flesh. And herein I have some exercise.</p>

<p>“As to outward dispensations, if we may so call them, we have not
been without our share of beholding some remarkable providences and
appearances of the Lord. His presence hath been amongst us, and by the
light of His countenance we have prevailed. We are sure the good will
of Him who dwelt in the bush has shined upon us; and we can humbly
say, we know in whom we have believed, who is able, and will perfect
what remaineth, and us also in doing what is well-pleasing in His
eyesight.</p>

<p>“Because I find some trouble in your spirit, occasioned first, not
only by the continuance of your sad and heavy burthen, as you call it,
upon you; but by the dissatisfaction you take at the ways of some good
men, whom you love with your heart, who through this principle, that it
is lawful for a lesser part (if in the right) to force, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“To the first: call not your burthen sad nor heavy. If your Father
laid it upon you, he intended neither. He is the Father of lights, from
whom cometh every good and perfect gift; who of His own will begot us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and bad us count it all joy when such things befall us; they bring
forth the exercise of faith and patience, whereby in the end (James
1st.) we shall be made perfect.</p>

<p>“Dear Robin, our fleshly reasonings ensnare us. These make us say,
heavy, sad, pleasant, easy. Was not there a little of this, when Robert
Hammond, through dissatisfaction too, desired retirement from the army,
and thought of quiet in the Isle of Wight? Did not God find him out
there? I believe he will never forget this. And now I perceive he is
to seek again, partly through his sad and heavy burthen, and partly
through dissatisfaction with friends’ actings. Dear Robin, thou and I
were never worthy to be doorkeepers in this service. If thou wilt seek,
seek to know the mind of God in all that chain of providence, whereby
God brought thee thither, and that person to thee: how before and since
God has ordered him, and affairs concerning him. And then tell me,
whether there be not some glorious and high meaning in all this, above
what thou hast yet attained. And laying aside thy fleshly reasoning,
seek the Lord to teach thee what it is; and he will do it.</p>

<p>“You say, ‘God hath appointed authorities among the nations, to
which active or passive obedience is to be yielded. This resides in
England in the parliament. Therefore active or passive,’ &amp;c.
Authorities and powers are the ordinance of God. This or that species
is of human institution, and limited, some with larger, others with
stricter bands, each one according to his constitution. I do not,
therefore, think the authorities may do any thing, and yet such
obedience due; but all agree there are cases in which it is lawful
to resist. If so, your ground fails, and so likewise the inference.
Indeed, dear Robin, not to multiply words, the query is, whether ours
is such a case? This ingeniously is the true question. To this I
shall say nothing, though I could say very much; but only desire thee
to see what thou findest in thy own heart, as to two or three plain
considerations. First, Whether <i>salus populi</i> be a sound position?
Secondly, Whether in the way in hand, really and before the Lord,
before whom conscience must stand, this be provided for; or the whole
fruit of the war like to be frustrated, and almost like to turn to what
it was, and worse? And this contrary to engagements, declarations,
implicit covenants with those who ventured their lives upon those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
covenants and engagements, without whom perhaps, in equity, relaxation
ought not to be. Thirdly, Whether this army be not a lawful power
called by God to oppose and fight against the King upon so stated
grounds; and being in power to such ends, may not oppose one name of
authority for those ends as well as another? the outward authority
that called them, not by their power making the quarrel lawful; but it
being so in itself. If so, it may be, acting will be justified <i>in foro
humano</i>. But truly these kind of reasonings may be but fleshly, either
with or against; only it is good to try what truth may be in them. And
the Lord teach us.”</p>

<p>The following letter,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
written from Bridgnorth in the year 1642, affords evidence of the fact,
that there were partizans of the Parliament in the town, who doubtless
did their best to alienate the minds of the people from the King’s
cause; and also that the rude conduct of the soldiers, in the royal
army, greatly aggravated the evil. The statements made on this latter

</div>

<p>The College, which stood in Saint Leonard’s Church Yard, had formerly,
it is supposed, been the residence of the Chauntry Priests belonging
to the Church, and after the Act for the Suppression of the Religious
Houses, it became the dwelling of the Master of the Grammar School.
The exact year of the foundation of this School cannot be ascertained;
but the Charity Commissioners, who visited Bridgnorth in 1815, fully
investigated the matter, and discovered that it was in existence in the
reign of Henry VIII. The following is an extract from their Report on
the subject:—“It appears from the return of the Commissioners under a
Commission of the 20th. July, in the second year of Edward VI., that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Grammar School, long before the said 20th. of July, had been
continually kept in the town of Bridgnorth, with the revenues of the
Chauntry of St. Leonard, in that town; and it appeared to the said
Commissioners, that the Schoolmaster then for the time being should
have for his wages, or salary, £8 a year, as before that time he was
allowed anciently out of the revenues of the said Chauntry.”</p>

<p>The Charity Commissioners of 1815 were equally unsuccessful in their
endeavours to ascertain the origin of the Almshouses which are situate
in the Church Lane; but they found, among the papers belonging to the
Corporation, the presentment and verdict of a Jury empannelled at
Bridgnorth, in the sixth year of Charles I., which proves that land was
granted to this Charity as early as the eighth year of Henry VIII. By a
Deed, however, which I copied from the Blakeway Papers in the Bodleian
Library, it is evident that the Almshouses of this locality were well
known in the parish of St. Leonard, in the earlier part of the reign
of Henry VII. The Deed is dated 1492, and is as follows: “Alice Wood,
prioress of ye house and ch. of St. Leonard, of ye White nuns of
Byrywood, and the convent of ye same place. Whereas John Bruyne, of
Bruggenᵗ, and his ancestors from time immemorial, have held of us, and

                DURING THE COMMONWEALTH.</h3>
</div>

<p>It is very important that the members of the Church of England, and
others, should receive some correct information on the subject of
religious persecution, or persecution for conscience sake; for a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
great mistake on the subject very commonly prevails—namely, that the
Dissenters have always been the suffering party, and the Church the
offending party, in this matter. At a time, indeed, when the duty of
toleration was little understood, some of the rulers of the Church of
England, as well as of the government of the day, did exercise the most
unjustifiable severity against those who ventured to separate from
the established religion. But the instances of this have been so much
insisted on, and have been so frequently made the subject of popular
declamation, that many have been led to imagine that the Church of
England has, again and again, been chargeable with the guilt of cruelly
persecuting her opponents, while the opponents have been guiltless of
any such wrong against her. But the impression is a most erroneous
one; for it may be asserted, without the fear of contradiction, that
the sufferings which the clergy endured in the short space of three
years during the Commonwealth, at the hands of those who had separated
from her, were in severity and extent greater than the whole amount
of suffering which she may have been the instrument of inflicting on
separatists for the hundred years
previous.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In proof of this, Gauden,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
in the Petitionary Remonstrance which he delivered to Cromwell, in
behalf of the suffering Clergy of England, stated that the number of
Ministers ejected from the benefices amounted to 8000. And Gauden
would not, in a public address, and to such a man as Cromwell, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
ventured to make a false or careless statement. But a much closer
investigation of the subject was afterwards made, and the result of
it was published by Walker, in his well known work, entitled—“The
Sufferings of the Clergy,” from which it may be seen that, if we
include in the catalogue the Cathedral Clergy, and the Clergy belonging
to the Universities, and chaplains,—as well as the parochial ministers
and their curates,—the sufferers far exceeded the number above stated.
By a resolution passed in the House of Commons, during the Protectorate
of Cromwell, all ministers were to be deprived of their benefices who
refused to sign the League and Covenant; and, consequently, numbers
who were too loyal to subscribe a document so hostile to the interests
of the King and the Church, were at once reduced to poverty, and had
to bear the severest hardships and privations. They and their families
were driven from their houses, not knowing where to look for food
and shelter; exposed also to the brutal insolence of the military,
who found as much pleasure in plundering a peaceful parsonage, as in
defiling the sanctity of the house of God. And these outrages appear
to have been sanctioned by those in authority, rather than repressed.
Besides this, numbers were thrown into prisons—the ancient palaces of
the Bishops being turned into jails for the purpose; and when these
and the common prisons in London were crowded with inmates, “many” as
Clarendon states, “both of the laity and clergy, were committed to
prison on board the Ships in the river Thames, where they were kept
under decks, and no friend suffered to come to them, by which many lost
their lives.” Nor is this to be omitted, in giving account of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
sufferings, that while they were enduring these wrongs, for conscience
sake—nay, suffering the loss of all things, rather than abandon their
principles—they were vilified in Parliament, and by the public press,
as being little better than criminals; and men, whose reputation had
never been blemished by a single stain,—whose deep learning, and still
deeper piety, would have reflected honor on any church of which they
had been members;—men who were saints indeed, in the true and ancient
sense of the word—were held up to public scorn, as if they were not
fit to live, and branded by the name of “malignant and scandalous
ministers.”</p>

<p>The recollection of these persecutions, inflicted on the loyal body
of the clergy, sharpened the feelings of the Government, after the
Restoration, against Dissenters; and those who then came into power
were too ready to make reprievals for the injuries and wrongs committed
during the Commonwealth. The consequence was, that many excellent
men, whose devotedness to God and whose zeal in the pastoral office
was unquestioned—men of whom, indeed, “the world was not worthy,”
and whose only offence was want of conformity to the Church, suffered
very severely; but their sufferings were trifling, both in extent or
severity, compared to the previous sufferings of the Clergy: so much,
indeed, does the one exceed the other, that Archbishop Bramhall, who
certainly was one not accustomed to utter words at random, says, “Let
Mr. Baxter sum up into one catalogue all the nonconformists throughout
the kingdom of England, even since the beginning of the Reformation,
who have been cast aside, or driven away. I dare abate him all the rest
of the kingdom, and only exhibit the Martyrologies of London, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
two Universities, or a list of those who in the late intestine wars
have been haled away to prisons, or chased away into banishment, by his
own party, in these three places alone; or left to the merciless world
to beg their bread, for no other crime than loyalty, and because they
stood affected to the ancient rites and ceremonies of the Church of
England, and they shall <i>double</i> them for number.”—<i>Grot: Relig.
p. 116.</i></p>

<p>It is very desirable that such facts as these should be known; not
that the knowledge of them may serve to ferment and keep alive any
feelings of hostility, or unkindness, towards those who still maintain
the principles of nonconformity—such a purpose cannot be too strongly
repudiated; but, that we may have an answer to give to such as charge
the Church with intolerance and persecution, and may be able to shew,
that in this respect she has been far more “sinned against than
sinning.” These facts also prove to us, and on this account they are
worthy of record, that the principles of the Church of England were
considered by our forefathers as worth suffering for; and that rather
than surrender the Articles of her Creed, or abrogate her regimen, they
willingly endured the severest penalties; took joyfully the spoiling
of their goods, and counted not their life dear unto them. Happily,
the day of persecution for conscience sake is past,—the spirit of
the age does not tolerate any thing like violence;—would that our
“unhappy divisions” were at an end also;—that all who love our Lord
Jesus Christ in sincerity were not only of one heart, but of one mind
also—were “perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same
judgement,” “spoke the same things,” “walked by the same rule;” not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
kept “the unity of the Spirit,” but also unity of worship and of
doctrine. This is the fellowship which the Scripture teaches should
subsist between the members of Christ’s Church; and nothing short of
this should be the object of your hopes and prayers.</p>

</div>

<p>The following particulars respecting Dr. Percy, have been very kindly
communicated to me by the Rev. H. E. Boyd, Rector of Dromara, in
the County of Down, who was for many years domestic Chaplain to the
Bishop:—“The Right Reverend Thomas Percy, D. D., Bishop of Dromore,
in Ireland, highly distinguished in the literary world, the son of
Arthur Lowe Percy, by his wife Jane Nott, was born at Bridgnorth, and
baptized the 29th of April, 1729; his grandfather, Arthur Percy, having
removed thither from the City of Worcester, where his family had been
settled for several generations. Arthur was grandson of Thomas Percy,
who was Mayor of Worcester, in 1662. The subject of this note received
the rudiments of his education at the Grammar School of Bridgnorth,
and graduated as A. M. from Christ’s Church College, Oxford, in 1753:
in November of that year, in the presentation of his College, he was
instituted to the Vicarage of Easton Manduit, in Northamptonshire,
which he retained until 1782. In 1756, he became resident, and was
presented to the Rectory of Willby, by the Earl of Sussex, whose
Mansion was close to the Parsonage. In 1759, he was married to Ann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Goderick, after an attachment of several years, to whom he had
addressed the pastoral ballad of “O Nancy, wilt thou go with me;” which
being transformed, by changing some words into the Scottish dialect,
“Nancy” into “Nannie,” “go” into “gang,” &amp;c., has passed with many
persons as an original Scottish ballad, written by Burns, or Allan
Ramsay. During his residence at Bridgnorth, through the kindness of
Mr. Humphrey Pitt, of Prior’s Lee, he became possessed of the M. S.
folio of Ancient Poetry, which exercised a magnetic influence on his
literary taste, and led to the publication of the Reliques, in 1764.
Through the kindness of the Earl of Sussex, he was introduced to the
Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, who appointed him their domestic
Chaplain, and patronized him in his Antiquarian pursuits. In 1769, he
became Chaplain in Ordinary to King George III.; and having obtained
the degree of S. T. P., from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he was
collated to the Deanery of Carlisle, 1778; and in 1782, elevated to the
see of Dromore, where he died 30th September, 1811, in the 84th year of
his age, revered by all sects and classes in his Diocese, to whom the
exercise of every virtue—piety, charity, and hospitality—especially
to his Clergy, had endeared him, during an episcopate of nearly thirty
years. There, his memory is still vividly preserved: and recollections
of his kindness are traditionally handed down from father to son by the
inhabitants of Dromore. He survived his excellent and amiable partner,
Mrs. Percy, about five years; they are both interred in a vault in the
north aisle of Dromore Cathedral, which was added in 1804, and erected
chiefly at the Bishop’s expense. The “Key to the New Testament,” a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
useful manual to the Divinity Student, and a translation of the “Song
of Solomon,” with some occasional Sermons, form the chief of the
Bishop’s theological labours. An allusion to his discursions in the
other various paths of literature, in which he was engaged, would
extend this notice to an inconvenient length. And as it is intended to
give a more detailed account of this eminent man, in case the copious
supply of materials, known to be in existence, be contributed and
placed in the hands of the writer, the brevity of this sketch will be
the less to be regretted.”</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the Petition, presented to Lady Bartue, the
draft of which is preserved among the papers of the Corporation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot space-below2">
<p>“We are bold (hearing of your noble and charitable disposition to
distressed people) to impart unto you, that in these miserable times
our Town is left a sad spectacle and pitiful object of the woeful
effects of war; for besides the firing of more than 300 families, we
had also burnt, a fair Church, College, Almshouse, and Market House;
whereby we are exposed to great misery and distress. The Parliament,
upon our humble address for some relief, hath vouchsafed us a Brief,
and we are upon that work, hopeing, by God’s blessing thereunto, we
shall live to see some of our public losses againe repaired. Now our
motion is humbly, that your Ladyship, having an old ruinous Barn, at
Wenlock, which would serve for the bonds of a new Market House, hearing
that it is to be sold, do address ourselves hereby to your Ladyship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
desirous that you would be pleased to sell us the same; and send us a
price in consideration of our poor condition. We are not willing to
meddle with the slate covering, only the wood and timber; entreating
that you will be pleased to favour us in the summer. We conceive it
worth £40 or £50 and great charge we shall be at to take it down. We
humbly beseech, that we shall have your Ladyship’s pleasure therein;
that we may know what to trust unto in that behalf. And you will oblige
unto yours—those by whom this Petition represent—the whole body of

</div>

<p>The foundation of this Charity has already been referred to <a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>,
and proofs given of its antiquity. An official report of it was drawn
up by the Rev. Wm. Corser, in 1792, and presented to the Corporation;
after a very careful investigation into its history. In this, he states
it as his opinion, that it was first established and supported by the
members of the Religious fraternity of the neighbouring College in St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Leonard’s Church Yard; though the management of it, and the right of
appointment to it, was vested entirely in the Corporation. The objects
of the Charity were originally poor persons, of either sex,—“the Alms
Houses being open to poor Burgesses’ wives; but, for the last hundred
years, the Charity has been confined to poor women,” the widows, or
unmarried daughters of Burgesses, seven chosen from the parish of St.
Leonard’s, and five from the parish of St. Mary’s. The management of
the Charity is placed by a late Act of Parliament, in the hands of “the
Trustees of General Charity Trusts.”</p>

Supplication and Petition of the Bailiffs and Burgesses of Our Town of
Bridgnorth, in Our County of Salop, as also by a Certificate under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
hands and seals of our Trusty and well-beloved Subjects, Sir William

Knight, Richard Scriven, Thomas Whitmore, Robert Sandford, Robert
Leighton, and Thomas Holland, Esqs.; Justices of the Peace, at the
general Sessions of the Peace held for the said County, at Salop, on
Tuesday next after the Feast of the Epiphany, now last past, that in
the year of our Lord One Thousand, Six Hundred, Forty and Six, at which
time, our said Town being kept as a Garrison for Our dear Father, the
same was surprized by the contrary party then in Arms, and the upper
town thereof being set on fire, all the houses and the greatest part of
the goods and wares therein, and their Market House, the Colledge, Alms
Houses, and great Collegiate Church, were burned down and consumed, and
that at the said Sessions, it appeared to our said Justices, by the
Oaths of Edward Whitehead and Michaell Millington, able and sufficient
persons; that the losses sustained by the same fire, do amount in the
whole unto the value of Threescore Thousand Pounds at the least; which
being to the utter destruction and laying waste of Our said town, and
the great impoverishment and undoing of the Inhabitants thereof, unless
they shall be relieved by the love and charity of such whose hearts
the Lord (who is the great disposer of hearts) shall warm and stir up
to commiserate them in this their most deplorable condition, Our said
Justices did humbly certifie the same to Our Princely and Christian
consideration, to the end that our gracious Letters Patents for a
collection of the charitable benevolence of our well-disposed subjects
of Our Kingdome of England, might be granted unto Our said Bailiffs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Burgesses, and other Inhabitants of our said town, for and towards
their relief and the re-edifying of the said Collegiate Church and
Colledge. We therefore, and upon the Petition of the said Bailiffs,
Burgesses, and Inhabitants have thereunto condescended, not doubting
but that all compassionate and tender-hearted Christians rightly and
duely considering the Premisses and the miserable and mutable state
of man through these inevitable and deplorable accidents, (none
knowing how soon they may fall into the like calamity) will be ready
and willing to extend their liberal contributions towards this so
charitable and pious a work, the same tending not only to the relief,
support, and refreshment of Our said distressed subjects in their
great necessity, but to the advancement of the Honour and Worship
of Almighty God. Know ye therefore, that of Our especial grace and
Christian compassion have given and granted, and by these Our Letters
Patents under Our great Seal of England, We do give and grant unto
Our said poor distressed subjects, the Bailiffs, Burgesses, and other
Inhabitants of Bridgnorth aforesaid, and to their Deputy and Deputies,
the Bearer and Bearers hereof, authorized and deputed in that behalf,
as hereafter in these presents is appointed, full power license and
authority, to ask, gather, receive and take the alms and charitable
benevolence of all of Our loving subjects whatsoever; inhabiting
within our Kingdome of England, and all and every the Cities, Towns
corporate, priviledged places, Parishes, Hamblets, Villages, and in all
other places whatsoever, within our said Kingdome, for and towards the
re-edifying, rebuilding, and repairing of the said Collegiate Church,
College, and Alms Houses, in the first place; and after for and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
towards the reimbursements and recovery of the losses and for the
future support of Our said poor distressed subjects, and for the
relief of them and their desolate families, which being a work of so
Christian and charitable concernment, will doubtless be readily and
fervently promoted and performed by all well-disposed people, who
upon their serious and due consideration of the said great Losses,
will, with a fellow-feeling of the miseries and distresses of their
fellow Christians extend their free and cheerful contributions more
then ordinary in this pious and blessed work, for in so doing they do
lend unto the Lord, and hence it is that wisdom itself hath said and
testified, That it is more blessed to give than to receive. Wherefore,
We will and command you, and every of you, that at such time and
times, as the said Bailiffs, Burgesses, and Inhabitants of Bridgnorth
aforesaid, their Deputy or Deputies, the Bearer or Bearers hereof,
(authorized and deputed as hereafter in these presents is appointed,)
shall come and repair to any of your Churches, Chappels, or other
places, to ask and receive the gratuities and charitable benevolence
or Our said loving Subjects, quietly to permit and suffer them so to
do, without any manner of your lets, or contradictions. And you, the
said Parsons, Ministers, Lecturers, Vicars and Curates, for the better
stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish according
to the tenor of these Our Letters Patents, or brief hereof unto the
people, upon the Lord’s Day next after the same shall be tendered unto
you,—exhorting, perswading, and stirring them up to extend their
liberal contributions towards this so pious and charitable a work. And
you, the said Churchwardens of every Parish, and Collectors for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
poor, where such Collection is to be made, as aforesaid, together
with such other honest active men there, as shall be nominated by the
minister and your selves, are hereby willed and required to collect and
gather the Alms and charitable benevolence of Our said loving subjects:
not only Householders, but also Servants, Strangers, and others: And
if you shall find it more expedient for an effectual performance of
this pious work, you are to go from house to house in your respective
parishes, upon the Week dayes, to gather the Alms of Our said loving
subjects. And what shall be by you so gathered by vertue of these
presents, in the said parishes and places, to be by the Ministers and
yourselves, endorsed on the back side of these our Letters Patents,

such manner and order as the said Sir Thomas Wolrich, Sir William
Whitmore, Sir Walter Acton, Sir John Weld the younger, Thomas Whitmore
and Thomas Holland, Esquires, and Michael Thomas, Rector of Stockton,
in the said County of Salop, or any three or more of them, shall by
writing under their hands and seals direct and appoint the same. And
lastly, for the more assurance of faithful and equal dealing in the
receipt accompt, and distribution of the moneys hereby to be collected
as aforesaid, and that the said Bailiffs, Burgesses, and Inhabitants
of Bridgnorth aforesaid, may not be defeated of any part thereof, but
enjoy the full benefit of this Our Royal favour extended to them, and
that a true and honest accompt may be given and rendered to them, Our
will and pleasure is, that no man shall be employed to collect any of
the said moneys but such only as shall be appointed and authorized

as shall be so deputed, to make the said collections within our City of
London, and the liberties and suburbs thereof, shall beside the said
Deputation procure a Testimonial in this behalf from the Lord Mayor of

when such collection shall be made as aforesaid, the said several
Churchwardens are required to return to each respective Chief Constable
the Briefs received by them, together with the moneys collected by
the same, to be endorsed thereupon and subscribed in manner as is
hereby before directed and appointed, and the said chief Constables

chief Constables are to deliver and pay the said moneys so by them to
be received, together with the said Brief or Briefs so endorsed as
aforesaid, unto the bearer or bearers of these our Letters Patents,
so to be deputed as aforesaid, at the Assizes next after such their
receipt thereof whensoever holden within the several and respective
Counties, or whensoever they shall be required thereunto, by the person

<p>What makes the resistance of these Prelates to the unconstitutional
proceedings of James the more remarkable is, that they afterwards
submitted to deprivation, rather than renounce their allegiance to him.
When he was deposed, or as others would represent it, when he abdicated
the throne, they could not be persuaded by any inducements to abjure
his sovereignty, and to take the oath of allegiance to William. They
regarded James as still their lawful King, and judged that it would
be a violation of the law of God for them to renounce his authority:
and, therefore, neither the remembrance of the wrongs which he had
done them, nor the prospect of what they might be called to suffer
for maintaining their allegiance to him, could shake their fidelity.
They refused, notwithstanding the many overtures which were made to
them, to take the customary oaths to the new King, hence the name of
“Non-Jurors.” They were perhaps extreme in their views, and carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
their principles of non-resistance and passive obedience so far, as
to involve them in great practical difficulties, which has afforded
to their opponents matter for much contemptuous ridicule. But those
who express this scorn for the principles of the Non-Jurors, should
remember that they were the principles maintained by every protestant
community before the revolution—maintained as strenuously by
Burnet<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and Tillotson, during the reign of the Stuarts, as by the seven
Bishops. Here lay the difference, that on the accession of William, the
former renounced these doctrines, and, in consequence, were advanced
to high places of honour and emolument: the latter still adhered to
them, though their adherence cost them the loss of all things. This too
happened at a time when, according to the testimony of Mr. Macaulay,
principle was a very rare quality indeed in public men of any party;
so that the sacrifice which the non-juring Bishops and Clergy made for
conscience sake stands out in striking contrast to the selfishness and
corruption which every where surrounded them. This contrast is so ably
drawn by a writer in the Christian Remembrancer, of April last, that I
think it well to submit it to the Reader.</p>

<p>“To this scene of falsehood and perfidy and unbridled selfishness,—to
the duplicity of the great men, and the corruption of the little men in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the state,—there was at this time one striking contrast. There was
one body of men in England, who, in spite of the low tone of public
honesty, did through evil report, through scorn and ridicule, through
the loss of their daily bread, stick to their principles. There was
one body of men possessed of reputation and competence, and some of
them of high station and wealth, who might have kept all—have been
caressed and flattered, at least feared or treated with respect—might
at least have kept their freeholds and their influence, their peerages
and palaces, or their quiet country parsonages, merely by saying a few
words against their convictions, and who would not. It was nothing
very fearful or profligate that they were called to do. It was then,
and is still, even among those who sympathise with them, a great
question whether they ought not to have done it. It was something for
which, had they wanted a pretext, they could have found not pretexts
but good reasons, in the example, and opinion, and authority of
numbers of their brethren—good, and conscientious, and pure-minded
men. It was something which Beveridge and Bishop Wilson could do
with a clear conscience. But their consciences would not allow them
to do it; and they did it not. Call them over-scrupulous, call them
narrow-minded, say that they were entangled and misled by a false
theory of government, still the fact remains; their duty seemed to them
clear and plain, and their duty they followed at all costs. They lost
everything by it; they were cast out of the Church, they were cast out
of the State; too few to have any influence, too unpopular to hope
for converts, they found themselves cut off from the body of their
countrymen, cut off from all the chief walks of life, homeless and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
living on alms, pitied by friends, suspected by all in power, ridiculed
by the world, plunged into the miseries and perplexities of a new
and difficult course of action, and of a small isolated clique, with
small comfort for the present, and small hope for the future. Granting
all that their critics or their enemies said of them—and they have
had keen critics and rancorous enemies,—that they were fretful and
cross-grained, that they were peevish and could not reason—that they
were censorious and ill-natured to their opponents—that their theories
were absurd, their heads hot, their intestine quarrels about small
points very petty—granting that Sancroft was sour and self-opiniated,
Turner a busy plotter, Collier indiscreet and a proud priest, that
Dodwell had odd notions on the immortality of the soul, and that Hickes
was as tiresome as Mr. Macaulay himself about the Theban legion—still
there is no denying the fact, that while the great men of the day,
who were having their will, and riding on the high places of the
earth, were, most of them, men whom we should shun as we do sharpers
and swindlers—the mocked and ruined Non-jurors were honest men.”
(<i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, <i>vol.</i> <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>,
<i>pp. 412-413</i>).</p>

<p>One of these has left a name in the Church which will be honoured, as
long as simplicity and godly sincerity are held in estimation among
men. The life of Bishop Ken, both before and after his deprivation,
was one so blameless and harmless—one of such uniform gentleness and
charity, as to win almost universal reverence and regard; and the
record of it has extorted the admiration of those who are most opposed
to his principles. He refused to take the new oath of allegiance. After
giving the subject every possible consideration, and calmly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
dispassionately deliberating on it, he felt that he could not with
a clear conscience swear fidelity to William and Mary as his liege
sovereigns, and he submitted patiently to the penalties which his
refusal brought upon him. He felt it his duty to enter a public protest
against the act of the government, which deprived him of his Bishopric;
but he retired from it without a murmur, attended, however, by the
tears and lamentations of his flock, who had known him long enough to
form an estimate of his character, and to calculate their loss in being
deprived of his overseership and counsel. Like others of his Brethren,
he would have been reduced to great poverty, had not his attached
friend and College companion, Lord Weymouth, received him into his
house, at Longleat. There he lived for upwards of thirty years after
his deprivation, and there he died. He suffered during his latter years
an amount of bodily anguish, which few men are called on to endure,
and this he sought to alleviate, and not in vain, by the exercise of
prayer and contemplation, and by indulging in strains of sacred poetry,
for which he had a natural aptitude. These he called anodynes, and
“alleviations of Paine,” and such they proved to him. His Biographer
states that “writing, saying, and singing hymns, were his chief solace:
they turned his mournings into penitential sighs.” His death was
like his life, one of perfect peace. His burial was in harmony with
his character, free from ostentation and parade. His special request
was that he might be buried in the Church Yard of the nearest parish
without any manner of pomp or ceremony, and that he might be carried to
the grave by six of the poorest men in the parish. He left in his last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Will this declaration of his stedfast attachment to the Church, which
coming from one of his stamp is of no small importance in these days of
disloyalty and division:—</p>

<p>“As for my Religion, I die in the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith,
professed by the whole Church, before the disunion of the East and
West: more particularly I die in the Communion of ye Church of England,
as it stands distinguished from all Papall and Puritan innovations, and
as it adheres to the doctrine of the Crosse.”</p>

There can be no doubt that there was in ancient times a bridge at
Quatford, for it is called in old writers, “Cwatbridge.” It was very
likely a wooden bridge, one pier of which stood on an islet in the
stream. In the very ancient map of Bridgnorth, and of its immediate
neighbourhood, which is in possession of the Corporation, (a copy of
which will be found in the present volume) this islet is marked out,
and called “Brugg Bylett,” or Island Bridge. The present Ferryman,
Richard Turley, very well recollects this bylet, and his having played
on it when a boy: it was nearly a quarter of an acre in size, and
covered with alders and willows. An old villager told the late Mr.
Smallman that he remembered beams of wood being raised from that part
of the river.</p></div>

This narrative may possibly be somewhat tinctured with
the superstition which prevailed at the time; but there is no reason
to doubt the general truth of it. Mr. Eyton, to whom I am indebted for
my acquaintance with it, after giving the whole of the narrative in
detail, in Vol. 1, part 2, p. 107, of his Antiquities of Shropshire,
makes this comment on it:—“The whole of this narrative is credible in
itself, and minutely consistent with other ascertained facts; nor need
we take exception even to the Priest’s dream, for who knows not that
the feverish sleep of over fatigue will invest our hopes and anxieties
with some garb of life-like reality. Moreover this priest lived at a
time when priests were taught to believe in and to expect such special
revelations of the divine will.” </p>

<p>“Parts of this story nevertheless, require explanation; and the whole
of it must be tested by other facts and dates before we admit it to
that credence, which the details of a legend most seldom deserve.”</p>

<p>He has applied such tests, and has been fully satisfied with the
result.</p></div>

There is a yew tree known to the writer, at present growing in the
church yard of Sampford Arundel, in the county of Somerset, but now
hollowed by age, respecting which there is certain evidence, that more
than a century has passed over it, without producing seemingly any
change whatever in its state of decay; it is now, to all appearance, as
it was more than a hundred years ago.</p></div>

That a single tree may be so decayed by time as to be divided into
parts, and that these living parts may have the appearance of separate
trees, we have a remarkable proof in the famous chestnut on Mount Etna,
which was alive in the close of the last century.</p>

<p>Gilpin in his “Forest Scenery” has the following description of
it:—“It is still alive (1791), but it has lost much of its original
dignity. Many travellers take notice of it. Brydone was the last who
saw it. His account is dated about sixteen or seventeen years ago. It
hath the appearance of five distinct trees. The space within them, he
was assured, had been filled up with solid timber, where the whole
formed only one tree. The possibility of this he could not at first
conceive, for the five trees together contained a space of 204 feet in
diameter. At length he was convinced, not only by the testimony of the
country and the accurate examination of the Canon Recufero, a learned
naturalist in those parts, but by the appearance of the trees, none
of which had any bark on the inside. This chestnut is of such renown,
that Brydone tells us he had seen it marked in an old map of Sicily,
published an hundred years ago.”—(<i>B. 1., p. 135.</i>)</p></div>

There is little doubt that this castle stood on the picturesque rock
which overhangs the Severn, near the Ferry. A few years since, the
late Mr. Smallman opened the trench which partly surrounds it, and
removed from it three hundred cart loads of rubbish; the whole of
which had evidently been thrown in from the inside, the strata lying
in that slanting direction; and underneath he found several Norman
relics, and fragments of the same stone of which the church was built;
and as this stone was brought from Gloucestershire, it affords a
pretty plain proof that the building of the church and castle were
cotemporaneous.</p></div>

“However odious Robert had now become; though his turbulent and
vindictive character had left him but few friends, the scene which
followed must have been affecting to those who could reflect, if
such there were, on the instability of human grandeur. On the King’s
approach to Shrewsbury, the Earl quitted the town, perhaps for the
last time; bearing himself the keys of the gates, he threw himself

It is very remarkable that King Henry II. was saved from death on
another occasion by a singular accident, as he was entering the town

not his horse, by the sudden lifting up his head, received it in his
forehead.”—<i>Collection of the Historie of England, p. 91.</i></p></div>

One of the days on which King John was at Bridgnorth happened to be a
fast day, notwithstanding which, he, being wearied most probably with
his incessant marches, ate twice; for which supposed offence he atoned
by feeding a hundred paupers with bread, fish, and beer.—(<i>Antiquities
of Shropshire, Vol. 1, p. 269.</i>) His scrupulosity in this matter is the
more remarkable from the fact, that however important the scriptural
exercise of fasting may be on certain occasions, yet it has always
been dispensed with under the circumstances in which John was then
placed—viz: taking a fatiguing journey.—(<i>Bishop Taylor’s Works, Vol.
3, p. 170.</i>)</p></div>

It is a very common opinion, that the suppression of
the Religious Houses in the reign of Henry VIII. was universally
countenanced and encouraged by the Reformers; and Roman Catholic
writers are very anxious to give this opinion currency; but it is
wholly groundless. Almost all the Bishops of the new learning, as the
Reformers were called, were against the misapplication of the Abbey
lands; and Queen Anne Boleyn, though so strong a favourer of the
Reformation, is said to have been so averse to the measure, that she
put up Bishop Latimer upon preaching against it before the King. On the
other hand, the measure found very strong advocates among the Roman
Catholics, Laity and Clergy; and of these one of the most conspicuous
was the famous Bishop Gardener, who is said to have been as busy as any
in declaiming against the Religious Houses, and to have commended the
King in many of his sermons for suppressing them.—See some curious

The Duke of Buckingham, in his communication with the Bishop of Ely,
is represented by Hall, (an historian of the 16th century) as thus
expressing himself in reference to this matter:—“But whether God so

to conclude sodaynlye on thys litte, and to sette it open amongeste
the common people, or to kepe it secrete awhile, so the chaunce was I

as though I had never seen her; so that she and her sonne the Earle
of Richmonde be both bulwarke and portcolies, and the gate to enter
into the majestie royall, and gettynge the crowne. And when we had
commoned a little concernynge her sonne, as I shall shewe after,
and were departed, she to our Ladye of Worcester, and I towards

In proof of the intellectual power of Charles, additional to that of
his successful controversy with Henderson, the following statement may
be given in the words of Mr Tytler:—“In the two months’ negotiations
which followed, Charles, unassisted, carried on a contest of argument
on arduous political topics with these fifteen of the ablest senators
of the day; and the commissioners were not more struck with the ravages
which persecution and suffering had wrought in his appearance, (his
hair had become entirely grey) than with the clearness of intellect,
the readiness of elocution, and the dignity of deportment, which he
displayed at these important conferences.”—<i>Trials of Charles I.,

The conduct and demeanour of Charles, at his trial, and on the
scaffold, have drawn even from the pen of Mr. Macaulay a passage
expressive of his admiration, and a passage so eloquent as to shine
even in his brilliant pages. But it is not more just, perhaps not more
eloquent, than the following description which is given of Charles in
the hour of adversity, by Professor Smyth:—“With what sentiment do we
now behold him?... it is the monarch unsubdued by adversity—it is the
hero unappalled by death—it is the Christian sublimed by piety and
hope—it is these that occupy our imagination and our memory. It is the
tribunal of violence—it is the scaffold of blood—that banish from our
minds all indignation but against his destroyers—all terrors but of
the licentiousness of the people: that render all regular estimation
of his character odious and impossible; and that leave nothing in the
heart of the generous and humane, but compassion for his misfortunes,
and reverence for his virtues.”—<i>Lectures on Modern History, Vol. 1,
p. 441.</i></p></div>

It appears that the King was exposed to great personal hazard in this
battle, and owed his deliverance to the prompt and intrepid conduct
of Adam Hill, Esq., of Spaldwick. When Prince Rupert, by his rash
pursuit of the enemy’s cavalry, had thrown the royal army into a
state of disorder, the King was at one time in danger of being taken
prisoner, when this brave officer, by rallying a troop of horse, of
which he was in command, checked the advance of the enemy, and thus
averted the King’s danger. Charles shewed his sense of this gallant
feat of arms, and his gratitude for this service, by investing him on
the field of battle with his own royal scarf. This gorgeous scarf,
the material and workmanship of which is peculiarly beautiful, having
descended as an heirloom to Peter Denny, a grandson of Adam Hill’s by
his daughter Cordelia, is now in the possession of Sir Edward Denny,
Bart, of Tralee.—<i>“Royal Presents to the Denny’s” by Rev. A. B. Rowan,

In this Diary there are two or three curious entries, which, though
not referring to any matter of public importance, it may be as well to
transcribe: one, detailing a singular occurrence, is connected with
a name well known in Bridgnorth. “Monday, Oct. 13. Captn. <i>Gatacre</i>,
of this County, (Salop) killed in Bridgnorth by a Quarter Master, and
the Quarter Master killed too by him.” “Friday, Oct. 17. A Scott was
tryed at Bridgenorth, at a Council of Warre, that he put on his hatt
before his Majestie, and being reprehend for it by the Govr., he told
them he was equal to all but the Govr., and they committed him for it.”</p></div>

The only difficulty that there is in assigning to this letter the date
of October, 1642, is that the king speaks in it of Lord Goring being
in command of his horse; whereas, we learn from Whitelock, that Lord
Goring, in the Autumn of that year, took ship from Portsmouth, where he
was closely besieged by the Parliamentary army, and fled to Holland.
(<i>Memorials, p. 62.</i>) But Whitelock does not give the exact date of
the siege of Portsmouth, so that the King may have written this letter
to his Secretary Nicholas from Bridgnorth, before it took place, or at
least before he had received any tidings of it.</p></div>

One could wish, as a mere matter of curiosity, that a remarkable
building, called “Forester’s Folly,” had been amongst those which
escaped the fire; for it was built by Richard Forester, the private
secretary of no less famous a person than Bishop Bonner, and bore the
above appellation most likely on account of the cost of its erection.
William Baxter, the Antiquary, who was a descendant of Forester, has
the following passage in his life referring to the circumstance:—</p>

<p>“Proavus meus Richardus de isto matrimonio susceptus uxorem habuit

terms of the Capitulation; and it was required that he should be given
up unconditionally to the Parliament. This was protested against by
the Royalists, who said that it would be as much as consenting to his
murder, and that no such exception had been made in any articles of
surrender, except in the case of Mr. Latham, which was not a similar
case, inasmuch as he, Mr. R., was one of the Prince’s Soldiers,—and

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&#8212;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
